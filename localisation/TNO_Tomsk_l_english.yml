 POLITICS_BORIS_PASTERNAK_DESC:0 "Boris Leonidovich Pasternak is not a politician by trade, but rather a poet and a scholar. A Muscovite of Jewish ancestry, he quickly became renowned in the early days of the Soviet Union for his collections of poetry and translations of English and German classics. However, his early admiration for Lenin soon wore out, and he found himself scrambling to try and get friends and colleagues off of blacklists and out of prisons. Pasternak, despite his reputation suffering, never saw official censure or persecution himself, as many within the Politburo and NKVD viewed him as too passive and detached from reality to pose a political threat. As the Germans marched closer to Moscow, Pasternak and the remnants of the Soviet intelligentsia fled to the east, with many taking refuge in the city of Tomsk. There, they decided to draft a liberal constitution inspired by the undying Russian democratic thought and pledged to restore the freedom of expression that they craved under Soviet rule. Their cause gave a birth to the Central Siberian Republic, which proved itself to be a worthy foe to the declining dictatorship of the Far Eastern Soviet state, but soon collapsed under its own weight, unable to cope with ambitions of their own generals.\n\nPasternak now rules a state dominated by intellectuals and artists, full of thinkers and poets. Although he and his colleagues give wonderful speeches, draft laws that are fascinating to read, and compose beautiful anthems, their only previous experience in holding office has been on university faculties. Whether Pasternak and his nation of dreamers will achieve anything or be content to sit in their ivory towers is a question that has yet to be fully determined."
