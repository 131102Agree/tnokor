 POLITICS_MOHAMMAD_REZA_PAHLAVI_DESC:0 "The King of Kings, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi ascended to the Iranian throne in 1941, his father forced into a humiliating abdication during an abortive invasion from the Soviet Union and British Empire. International scholars have since come to argue that this was when the Shah first became sympathetic to the German people, two great empires held down and abused by the old European order.\n\nThe decades since Mohammad Reza's ascension to the throne have seen the relationship between the Shah and his German friends develop ever closer, the German Reich making every effort to bring Iran into their own sphere following the war providing all manner of recovery aid, international loans and military advisors. It was a relationship which would be showcased to the world in August 1953 in a German orchestrated coup against then Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh and installation of a firmly pro-German government, the Shah himself greatly empowered and welcoming the German Reich into Iran with open arms.\n\nYet whilst the Shah may now enjoy the power and luxuries worthy of a true monarch, to say that the ground beneath him is shaky would be a great understatement. Having lost the trust of the populace, the Iranian people take to the streets to demand all manner of political, social and economic reform, with an increasingly influx of German racial science inflaming racial conflict across Iran. So too have his German benefactors began to demand reform, desiring a more liberal Iran which may remain in their sphere to a one aflame. Now with the 2,500th anniversary of the Iranian monarchy imminent, and pressures abound, the Shah stands determined to ensure it will be one to last for 2,500 years more."
