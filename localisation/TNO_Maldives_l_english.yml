 POLITICS_MALDIVES_MIKE_HOARE_DESC:0 "It is with some sort of humor that the Indian subcontinent, where Thomas Michael Hoare was born, has been the site of his greatest accomplishment in his long career of warfare. Born in Calcutta in 1919, Hoare joined the London Irish Rifles at 20, when the Second World War began. In his time as a soldier for the British, he fought in the unsuccessful Arakan Campaign, and then, ironically, against the Azad Hind in the early stages of the final Bengali Campaign before the British withdrew from India - and Hoare with them. He then served in the British Isles Campaign before they fell, and moved to South Africa, where he became a safari leader - as well as a soldier-for-hire.\n\nHoare found his way into Zentralafrika in the late 1950s, and performed multiple missions for the Reichskommissariat, including anti-partisan operations. During the South African War, he continued to serve Müller's forces, fighting against American forces just as he had done against partisans. After that was done, he roamed the world, serving no single man nor country. That is, until he received an offer from his old home: India.\n\nHoare's latest mission is far from standard. In typical fashion, he was put in charge of the force that would sieze the newly-independent Maldives for the Azad Hind Government. However, instead of taking off and leaving after his work was done, he would remain in a governmental role as leader of the Maldives. Few were surprised when Hoare was found to be in charge of the Indian troops - after all, the Azad Hind is known for its use of soldiers of fortune - but they were shocked to find him taking on a role of governance. Hoare's job description has changed, as the decision lies before him - shall he serve as an ally of the Maldivians and the Indians, or shall he show the inhabitants of his new realm why people call him Mad Mike Hoare?"
