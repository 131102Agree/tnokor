 POLITICS_SIEGFRIED_MULLER_DESC:0 "지그프리트 뮐러 국가판무관은 용맹하고 사람을 이끄는 매력을 가졌으며, 제국 내에서 미디어의 사랑을 가장 많이 받는 인물입니다. 첸트랄아프리카 국가판무관부의 카리스마있는 지도자이자 아프리카의 세 총독들 중 가장 부유한 사람이기도 합니다. 폴란드, 프랑스, 러시아에서 방면 전선에 섰던 베테랑 뮐러는 계속해서 돈을 빼돌리고 이익을 숨기는 거의 반역에 가까운 짓을 하지 않으며, 첸트랄아프리카를 독일에게 지속적인 이익을 가져다 주는 유일한 식민지로 만들었습니다. 그의 첸트랄아프리카 통치 방식은 좋게 보자면 "자유방임주의" 라고 표현할 수 있겠지만, 나쁘게 본다면 "거의 완전한 무관심" 이라고 말해도 과언은 아닙니다. 외국계 기업이 오직 이익을 위해 콩고를 황폐화시키는 반면에 첸트랄아프리카 정부의 금고는 선박 통행료로 인해 점점 불러가고 있습니다. 그러거나 말거나 뮐러와 독일인들은 멍청하게 술독에 빠져 살면서 살아 움직이는 것이라면 뭐든지 사냥하고, 치마를 입은 것이라면 모조리 겁탈하고, 모든 봉급을 노름으로 탕진하면서 복무 기간을 허송세월하기만 합니다. 그들이 추태를 부리지 않을 때가 딱 하나 있는데, 다른 국가판무관이나 여타 국가들(독일인지 다른 외국인지는 중요하지 않습니다)에 싸구려 용병으로 팔려 나갈때입니다.\n\n 뮐러의 열정적인 취미활동은 사냥이며, 정기적으로 거대한 아프리카 속의 모든 종을 사냥하기 위해 어두운 수풀 속으로 긴 여행을 떠나곤 합니다. 만약 그가 여행 도중에 ANC 빨치산 속으로 걸어들어간다면, 그는 모든 사람들 중 가장 위험한 존재를 사냥할 기회를 얻게 될 겁니다...\n\n사람 말이죠."
 POLITICS_HANS_HUTTIG_DESC:0 "In all of the Reich, few names embody tenebrosity as stirrlingly as Reichskommissar Hans Huttig. Once the overseeing commandant of brutal extermination camps during the war, Huttig has devoted himself to ruthlessly fulfilling the National Socialist tradition over Ostafrika. Within labyrinthic camps of African slaves, and burgeoning swaths of revolting tribes he is seen a pernicious enigma of Nazi horror and a mathematician of ruination. For Huttig himself, he prefers to see himself as the only German in Africa who sees the truth: Africa is a continent with an heart of utter darkness; and a fist of damascus steel must crush her subhuman evil.\n\nHuttig's sworn loyalty to the Reich, domestic brutality, and organizational competence has been proved time after time again. From ensuring an effective, pure government, employing only Germans and refusing to use African SS divisions, to the constant drill and battling of his elite garrison, bolstered by the former Anglo population of Rhodesia, Huttig's rigid and militaristic society is more akin to a massive concentration camp than a colonial authority. Yet as his fellow governors leave their dominions to decadence and decay, they are seen as stars for their facsimiles of prosperity and undeserved wealth.\n\nIn return, Huttig harbours nothing but contempt for his peers, solely communicating with Reich and planning for the inevitable conflicts within the south and the east himself.  He has no disputes with the title affixed to him by foreign intelligence - the only Nazi in Africa. To him, Africa needs no one else."
 POLITICS_EMIL_MAURICE_DESC:0 "On one particular morning, a crowd of protestors surrounded the offices of Reichskommissar Emil Maurice, demanding basic welfare and at least some respect for human rights. In most other Reichskommissariats, these protests would be answered by a volley of open fire, and then a swift cleanup and denial of any activity against the State whatsoever. But when Maurice woke up and heard the rhythmic shouts of dissent, his only action was a meek request for the curtains to be closed. The fulminations soon dispersed after the building lay completely still.\n\nOnce the chauffeur and a personal favorite of Adolf Hitler, the inescapable, crippling apathy in Maurice seems to have begun to manifest after leaving the Reich in the fifties to oversee Madagascar, an appointment by the Führer  amid accusations of clear non-Aryan elements in his racial heritage from the SS. Given the choice between execution or exile, he choose the later. Since his arrival in Toamasina, Maurice has shown little, if any, care for the internal affairs of the colony, forgoing meetings and ignoring the screams of those who would have his head all across the island. He has sent pleas to return to the only country he ever loved countless times, all of which have been ignored.\n\nThe outlook has only grown more nihilistic for Maurice as the organized Jewish resistance strengthens and native Malagasy militias establish footholds in the central highlands, all while the militarists continue to estrange themselves with the administration. It is clear to those still loyal that an armed conflict looms near, and yet all he can show is indifference. All he dreams is for exile. He may have helped create this enormous house, but all he desires is to escape it. To be delivered from evil."
 POLITICS_WOLFGANG_SCHENCK_DESC:0 "Once one of the Reich's most decorated fighting aces, Wolfgang Schenck's administration over Südwestafrika is wrought by the air. He is renowned in the fatherland for flying hundreds of combat missions and in the Luftwaffe he is distinguished for expertise in the development of bombers. Domestically, however, he presides over the poorest Reichskommissariat in Africa, lacking an industrial base and relying on imports and gas fees for its runways. The burgeoning air force of the nation is his sole focus, as evident to anyone who ever looked over the Angolan horizon. His planes rule the sub-saharan skies.\n\nOver the years, Schenck has ensured that Südwestafrika is the air hub of German Africa. In other internal matters, he is known for his leniency and the close camaraderie he shares with fellow Reichskommissar Siegfried Müller, who he often attends Safaris with in his personal helicopters or joining in the hunt. Perhaps it is the refuge of the tropospheric clouds, away from affairs pertaining to natives or the SS, that attracts him to the skies. It is where solace lies."
