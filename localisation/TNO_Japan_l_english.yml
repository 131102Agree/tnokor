 ###LEADER DESCS###
 POLITICS_HIROYA_INO_DESC:0 "이노 히로야는 그리 인기있는 사람은 아닙니다. 본디 제국의회의 하원의원에 불과했던 이노는 스스로 토조 히데키, 후에는 그의 정치적 라이벌인 키도 코이치를 제거하기 위해 일본 정계의 복잡한 사안들을 능숙하게 처리했습니다. 하지만 일이 그렇게 쉽게 풀리지만은 않는 법. 그 정치적 야수들을 무찌르기 위해, 이노는 약간의 뒷거래를 성사시켜야만 했습니다. 그리 약간은 아니지만요. 그리고 그런 연줄들이 처음에는 꽤나 쓸만해 보였지만, 이노의 채무는 계속 쌓여갔고, 그는 일본 국민들보다도 다양하고 특별한 이해관계를 위해 일하게 되었습니다.\n\n이노는 제정 체제의 충실한 신봉자이며, 모든 정치적 논의의 최상위에 천황 폐하를 두기를 원합니다. 이노의 정당인 대정익찬회는 일본 유일의 합법정당이며, 다양한 이념을 가진 의원들의 넓은 연정을 아우르지만 천황 폐하의 옥좌를 의회의 난잡한 정치적인 문제들로부터 안전하고 확실하게 지켜냄으로서 유지될 수 있습니다. 그러나, 이노는 그의 정당에 대한 통제를 빠르게 잃고 있으며 그가 내각총리대신직에서 물러나는 것은 불가피해보입니다.\n\n제국의회의 많은 이들은 그가 토조와 키도를 무찌른 것과 같은 방식으로 이노가 물러나기를 바라며, 이는 일본 정계에서 줄곧 자신의 유의미한 위치를 지켜온 키도의 소망이기도 합니다. 만일 이노가 그의 이념을 지켜내고 파벌을 생존시키기를 원한다면, 그는 다시 한번 일본의 어두컴컴한 정계 속에서 안전한 그의 길을 찾아내야 할 것입니다. 마치 그가 과거에 수없이 그랬던 것처럼." 
 POLITICS_HIROHITO_DESC:0 "타이쇼 시대에 쌓이고 쌓였던 정치적 불안들로부터 불사조가, 황국의 권위가 날아올랐사옵니다. 천황 폐하, 일본의 신성한 통치자, 히로히토 텐노께서. 지난 40년 동안 일본은 태평양의 신출내기 제국으로부터 지구상에서 가장 거대한 대양의 실질적인 지배자가 되었사옵니다. 그 최상위에는 그 분께서 계시옵나이다. 태양의 여신 아마테라스의 후손이자 야마토의 자랑스러운 아들께서.\n\n1901년 4월 21일에 태어나신 히로히토 황자께서는 타이쇼 천황의 네 아드님 중 첫째이셨사옵니다. 1921년에 받아들이신 섭정직은 이후 폐하의 통치에 영감을 주었사옵나이다. 천황 폐하께서는 1926년 옥좌를 물려받으사오며, 폐하의 갈수록 군국주의화되어가는 제국을 이끄시어 만주의 이권을 얻어내시고 그 뒤에는 중국 전역을, 그리고 결국에는 태평양에 존재하는 서구의 모든 자산을 지배하시게 되셨사옵나이다.\n\n대동아전쟁의 종결과 함께, 열강으로서의 일본의 지위는 굳건해졌사옵니다. 다대한 양의 영토 획득은 황국에 막대한 부를 불러왔으며 신성한 폐하의 황권을 강화하였사옵니다. 폐하께서는 이제 공무로부터 완전이 손을 떼시었사오며 전화선 너머의 칙령으로만 폐하의 노복들과 소통하실 뿐이시옵나이다. 쇼와 시대의 천황으로서, 폐하의 제국은 흔들리고 있사옵니다. 곧, 거대한 변화가 찾아올 것이며 황국을 그 기반에서부터 흔들 것이옵나이다. 신민들이 과연 신성한 천황 폐하 외의 그 무엇에 의지할 수 있겠사옵나이까?"
 POLITICS_TAKAGI_SOUKICHI_DESC:0 "Soukichi Takagi has two core bases of support that would, at first glance, appear to be completely unrelated: student activists, and the Imperial Japanese Navy. Few can claim such disparate demographics as Takagi can. And yet, with examination, this becomes clear. With a distinguished service record during the Pacific War, which he was initially opposed to, Admiral Takagi has long remained a strong advocate of the IJN's forces (and continued funding). Most notable among his many assignments was heading the carrier group that assisted in the atomic bombing of Pearl Harbor.\n\nLikewise, Takagi enjoys much support from reform-minded members of the Imperial Diet, and student activists, who want to liberalize the economy and expand civil liberties, respectively. To these students, Takagi represents a future of liberty and free expression. And to the members of the Diet, he's a desperately-needed solution to Japan's economic woes.\n\nIn truth, Takagi's support is less stable than it looks. The IJN is only content so long as they are prioritized over the army, no matter who is in charge, and activists are infamously prone to sectarianism. If he is capable of navigating Japanese politics like he once did the waters of the Pacific, and he implements the reforms he wishes to achieve, then Japan's future indeed looks as bright as the rising sun."
 POLITICS_KIDO_KOUICHI_DESC:0 "Many said that Kido Kōichi already had his chance as Prime Minister, and that he wasted it. Ascending to the office following a political coup that Kido, alongside Ino Hiroya, executed against Hideki Tojo, Kido was initially immensely popular. This popularity stemmed not from an actual charisma or capability on Kido's part, but rather from the simple fact that he was not Tojo.\n\nThere were only so many deals that Kido could cut with special interests before Ino gathered the Diet's approval to supplant him. When Ino too fell into this same pit, Kido returned to power. And now that he's back, the Imperial Diet is beginning to remember why they wanted him gone in the first place.\n\nPerhaps one of Kido's few advantages in these times is his close relationship with the Emperor. During the Second World War and for some time after, Kido served as Hirohito's closest advisor, and he continues to hold the utmost concern for the honor of the Chrysanthemum Throne. But with the ever increasing distance between the Emperor and the Imperial Diet, Kido may be losing his edge.\n\nFor Kido Kōichi, surviving this political turmoil means avoiding the same mistakes he made before. And while experience is a valuable thing, the past is as good a predictor of the future as any."
 POLITICS_IKEDA_MASANOSUKE_DESC:0 "Few in Japan thought Ikeda Masanosuke had any chance of becoming Prime Minister. But then, few see things as Ikeda see them. A conservative and staunch Inoite, Ikeda represents the best and worst political instincts of conservatives through history. Leery of radicalism and skeptical of sudden change, the new Prime Minister wishes to uphold the current status quo in Japanese politics.\n\nThis is not to say that Ikeda is blind to the many failings of the Ino era. Corruption and loss of morality have caused wide cracks into the Japanese nation. The smooth cooperation between the Zaibatsus, the Army and the government has broken down. This has lured ambitious men, schemers, opportunists and other types of nogoodniks that wish not to see a healthy Japan, but to make a fortune sifting through its ruins. Public faith in the Diet has been shaken by the ugly sight of the Yokusankai breakdown after Ino's resignation. The nobility has lost faith with their partners in the political sphere. And through all this, foreign observers sharpen their knives in anticipation of a weaker Japan. All this has to be fixed.\n\nA political scientist by formation, and a newspaper editor by trade, Ikeda has never been naive to the grime and muck found in every government's dark corners. Now, he faces the difficult task of cleaning the house he himself has lived in for a decade. His thin coalition of Inoite conservatives, liberals and independents scrutinize his every move. But if not him, then who else? Japan must be dragged out of its darkest hour since the end of the war, and Ikeda knows he's the only shield against radicalism."
 POLITICS_KAYA_OKINORI_DESC:0 "Kaya Okinori likes numbers. People, he could take or leave. At least, this was the initial impression of the Japanese public upon first meeting the bureaucrat turned politician. His ability to channel the Japanese economy into a machine organized for total war raised his status considerably; his simple and amiable, if boring, personality made him look non-threatening. As a result, many reform bureaucrats turned to him as a leader of their faction after Kido Kōichimanaged to bungle his way out of power.\n\nLiking numbers better than people has not stopped Kaya from proving to be a phenomenal negotiator. After seeing the Army pull out every stop to bump Kido from power, Kaya has vowed not to commit the same mistake as his predecessor. As a result, the bureaucrat has slowly, carefully ingratiated himself with the Army. Once the high command deeply feared and distrusted the reform bureaucrat's radical program. Kaya Okinori has managed to convince them that he would defend their interests. As a result, the reform bureaucrats supplanted conservatives as the army's favorite faction. This backing has helped Kaya claw his way to the top, and now the reform bureaucrats have a true shot at changing Japan's direction.\n\nKaya Okinori likes numbers better than people, and his sudden role as a leader for the most powerful faction in Japanese politics is not an easy one for him to fill. The new Prime Minister thus relies on help from members of his faction. But below the surface, the policy consensus of the reform bureaucrat might be more fragile than it seems. Kaya Okinori hopes that his advisors will see reason and help him attain obtainable goals. Returning to the old reform bureaucrat's goal of a society completely subordinated to the government might have unforeseen consequences, after all."
 POLITICS_KAKUEI_TANAKA_DESC:0 "A proverb that is known to every Japanese child says, ''the talented hawk hides its claws''. Tanaka Kakuei, once the ascending dark horse of the Taisei Yokusankai, now the Prime Minister of Japan and always the ''Shadow Shogun'' of the Japanese politics, took this morale to his heart, excelling himself at the art of courtroom intrigues and dealing with the influential people. Constantly having been surrounded by massive corruption scandals for the whole duration of his career, Tanaka always succeeded to emerge unscathed from the situations that would sink a career of other, less unscrupulous, politicians, a quality which he owes to his own willingness to work hard for his ambitions, as well as his important connections to the Zaibatsu and the powerful party groups. Never being truly liked by the system he became a part of, Tanaka's rise to the heights of a Prime Minister was unforeseen and, perhaps, even somewhat unwarranted by the Japanese public, but as the initial favorites of the Yokusankai showed their inability to handle the continuing economic strife and saw their grandiose schemes shattered by the realities of the Japanese byzantine politics, it took little to reserve the empty seat and the favor of the Throne for the perfidious creature of the Zaibatsus.\n\nA beloved candidate of the Japanese patrician families, Prime Minister Tanaka pursues nothing but cementing the dominance of the Zaibatsus and breaking away with the economic dualism between Zaibatsus and Keiretsus that settled in Japan after the World War, of course, in favor of the former side. Forcing his way with the Zaibatsu money and pork barrel projects, Tanaka, however, does not forget about the pleas of a simple Japanese person and fancies himself as the man of the people. Tanaka promises a new era for Japan, the one that will provide a carefree life for Japanese workers and will double their salary in just five years - or else Tanaka will voluntarily step down from power."
 POLITICS_KONOE_FUMIMARO_DESC:0 "Prince Konoe Fumimaro was born into high hopes: an aristocratic upbringing in the Fujiwara clan, a prominent role in Government in diplomatic and then Diet postings, an Order of the Sacred Treasure Award given by the Emperor himself. A product of the old order, Prince Konoe was as regal as he was affable - the charm dazzled the press for a time, and some say he still shines with it. The Konoe star seemed destined for an inexorable rise as Konoe became Prime Minister in 1937, but even Konoe could not controlled the forces at work in interbellum Japanese politics. As the Marco Polo Bridge incident spiralled into one military adventure after another, the smiling Prince lost control of his own Party and Cabinet to trigger-happy militarists, and some say he still carries the old shame of his forced resignation and Long March into obscurity.\n\nSubsequent events proved his worries over the war in China right, but posterity has not been particularly kind to Konoe. Most remember him as the man who watched the sparks fly and the flames rise as Japanese sons died on foreign soil, and did nothing. Now Konoe has been appointed out of desperation by the very Party who pressured him out of his office, and age has sharpened his bitterness - but it has also cleared his sight, and his vision remains undimmed. Recent events have not changed his mind, only convinced him that the old order must be reforged. The Party that betrayed him and the Empire he lost must be woven into the ordered symphony he always wanted Japan to be. The Japanese nation was destroyed by people threatening this balance, but who better than a prince to save it? And Konoe will make it happen by any means necessary: a Fujiwara clansman will only fail once. He will not fail again."
