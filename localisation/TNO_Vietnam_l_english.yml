 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_BAO_DAI_DESC:0 "Bao Dai is a man haunted by could-have-beens; as a child, he was raised to the throne more or less by decree in the wake of his father's death, and his moves have been carefully planned by others for most of his life since then. Not much has improved significantly since the days of his youth; the puppet masters now speak Japanese rather than French, and the grain convoys go to Osaka and Nagoya rather than to Paris, but Vietnam still chafes under a foreign boot, and he with it. And he is powerless to stop it.\n\nAs emperor, Bao Dai has grown increasingly autocratic in his rule, preferring to rule without the help of his council. Which is ironic, considering those he relies upon to do his bidding are themselves loyal more to their paymasters in Tokyo than to the Emperor. Most of the rest of the country is indifferent to his decrees in any case, as Vietnam churns with rebellious sentiment and insurgents, just as it did in the last days of French rule. Ho Chi Minh lurks in the shadows, ready to pounce, and the overlords wait for a misstep to justify further intrusion.\n\nBao Dai sees his present and yearns for lost futures, for the dream of an independent and strong Empire that died when the Japanese marched in. His regrets are Vietnam's own; but unlike him, Vietnam has a chance of forging its own path and making it out alive. Bao Dai knows that when the future comes for him, he will be swept away, just another cobweb in the dusty hall. It's not like he has a choice in the matter."
