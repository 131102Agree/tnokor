 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_GENRIKH_YAGODA_DESC:0 "Back in the days of the old Soviet Union, Genrikh Grigoryevich Yagoda was a name that many knew, and were terrified of. As the Director of the NKVD, Yagoda was responsible for cementing the stability and security of Bukharin's regime, whom he had supported even in the initial power struggle that had led to his rise to power. With little more than a simple order from him, even the most prominent Bolsheviks could suddenly disappear or be executed for counter-revolutionary behavior.\n\nThen, when war broke out, large parts of the Union, even Moscow itself, fell under the German jackboot. In the ensuing chaos, Yagoda used the power he had been trusted with to evacuate much of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet to the east, as far away from the Reich as possible. In the end, he was able to establish control in the depths of Siberia. From there, he governed one of the most powerful successor states of the Union.\n\nThe state that the old Presidium built did not last, however. Again and again, enemies and traitors carved their own fiefdoms as Yagoda's empire slowly crumbled; from the hated reactionaries from Harbin, to the "democrats" of Central Siberia and its generals, to the treasonous revisionists just across Lake Baikal. Yet, despite all the blows the Irkutsk government has suffered, it still stands as yet another warlord state. What sets it apart, though, is its legitimacy - no other warlord can claim to be a direct continuation of the old government. Yagoda now controls a regime where the NKVD is responsible for protecting the final stronghold of the revolution, and only a handful of Bukharinist politicians can govern. That's all Yagoda has been left with, but it will suffice."
