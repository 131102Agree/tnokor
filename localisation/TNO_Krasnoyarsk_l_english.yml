 POLITICS_NIKOLAI_ANDREEV_DESC:0 "Born 1905, Nikolai Trofimovich Andreev was called up from the reserves to fully rejoin the Red Army in 1935, initially a political commissar in Siberia. Hoping to fight on the frontline against the Germans, he was instead enrolled in officers' school. But as the war became more and more desperate, he continued taking more and more classes - not to become more skilled, but to hopefully delay being sent to fight for what he saw as a lost cause. As the Soviet Union collapsed, he and a clique of fellow officers' school graduates began to consolidate their power in the Krasnoyarsk region. Yet when the Central Siberian Republic was established, they were justifiably concerned about any pre-existing groups that would threaten the democratic institutions and so the government broke up the clique and assigned them to the far-reaching corners of the Republic. Andreev was placed under the command of Nikolay Krylov, secretly remaining in contact with his clique.\n\nAs the Republic began to lose its grip on power and crumble apart, the clique reunited in Krasnoyarsk and mutinied against General Krylov during his doomed campaign against the Siberian Black Army. Now in order to convince the people of the city that they were not just another flavor of junta, Andreev and his officers have promised new and sweeping reforms. Free trade! Private property! Foreign allies! Open elections! Liberty! Democracy!\n\nWith the collapse of the previous order, the clique is considering that the matter of the Siberian reunification rests in their hands. Following that it will be a mad dash to the sea, and with it foreign recognition, before consolidating and preparing a push to liberate all of Russia. But whether Andreev will actually be able to deliver on these promises is another matter entirely."
