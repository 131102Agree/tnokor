 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 
 POLITICS_IVAN_GRISHIN_DESC:0 "The chaos that followed the Soviet defeat against the Germans allowed many unlikely figures to find their way to the heights of power which they would be denied in any other conditions. By the irony of fate, the burden of the father of the Kirghiz nation, or at least the claim of it, was granted to an ethnic Russian officer of the peasant background. That officer was Ivan Alexandrovich Grishin, now the leader of Kirghizia.\n\nGrishin did not see the Great Patriotic War, but he was a participant in every armed conflict in Central Asia, including the involvement of the Kirghiz SSR in the West Russian War, on the side of Soviet Kazakhstan. The deaths and retirements of his superiors made him a close associate of the former supreme commander of the Kirghiz SSR and eventually a designated heir to his cause.\n\nUnlike the predecessors, Grishin bitterly accepted irreversibility of the Soviet collapse and realized the futility to restore the Soviet order in Central Asia and Russia, a hope many of Grishin's comrades gave their lives for. Rather, he dedicated his remaining years to reinstating order in the Kirghiz SSR, keeping it safe and stable, not even slightly disturbed by perturbations of the outside world. The isolationist policy proved popular among the Kirghiz population, who started to regard Grishin as their natural leader, and his charismatic figure could convince even the Communist remnants and the Kirghiz nationalist officers to  together for the benefit of the whole country, even if they would would gnaw each other's throats under anyone but Grishin. Still, it is hard to say that the position of Grishin is truly secure. A devotee of stability above everything else, he never dared to oversee the serious changes in Kirghizia it truly needs and his reluctant allies of the national coalition grow more dissatisfied with his unwillingness to implement their vision of the ideal Kirghizia. Grishin was a ruler which the Kirghiz people desperately needed, but will he prove himself to be a leader they will need for the future?"
