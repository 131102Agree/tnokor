 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_BAURYZHAN_MOMYSHULY_DESC:0 "General Momyshuly is a hero of both the Soviet Union and Kazakhstan and he will always be loyal to his two homelands. He hails from a humble background and worked various state jobs in Kazkahstan before being conscripted and eventually would lead multiple division in the war. Some have called Momyshuly an anti-Soviet Kazakh nationalist due to his love of Alash Orda poetry, a few even calling for his removal from the Soviet armed forces completely. His loyalities would be tested with the German invasion. Not only were his loyalties to the Soviet Union confirmed, but so was his loyalty to Leninist doctrine itself.\n\nWhen the war ended, Momyshuly quickly reorganized the forces and commanders that remained and reestablished the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic. He now controls the most land and wields the strongest army in Kazakhstan. In his mind, the Soviet Union and communism has only been temporarily destroyed and is just waiting for a catalyst to revive it. He is determined to be that catalyst."
