 ### Leader Bios ###
 POLITICS_SABIR_AKHTYAMOV_DESC:0 "Sabir Akhtyamovich Akhtyamov may have been a Soviet citizen, but he is always a Tatar first, and he holds his homeland above all else. The son of a blacksmith, he was briefly drafted into the Red Amy, but the breakdown of the chain of command meant that he was never deployed to the front. When the Union collapsed, he simply stayed at home. The Tatar Autonomous SSR may have escaped the worst of the war, but thousands of its men were still sent off to never return. More importantly, they got their first taste of real freedom since the abortive Idel-Ural State of 1920. And once they had it, they were not eager to give it up. When the West Russian Revolutionary Front demanded suzerainty, the Tatars only accepted in exchange for significant autonomy and exemption from Russian laws. They had a tense, but peaceful, co-existence with the Front until the West Russian War, when the Russians tried to extend the Red Army draft to the Tatars. The thought of having to spill Tatar blood in a Russian war once again was too much for many to bear, Akhtyamov included.\n\nThe Tatar people took up arms, fighting for the freedom they were long denied. Akhtyamov made his name as a war hero in the time, renowned for both his battlefield prowess and his logistical skills behind the front lines. When the Russians gave way and retreated further north, people heaped laurels upon Akhtyamov and proposed he be elected mayor of Ufa. Being the highest-ranked civilian official, he was effectively the first President of Tatarstan, and it was his signature that ratified the Tatar constitution. He has helped earn his native land's freedom, and he will fight bitterly to defend it."
