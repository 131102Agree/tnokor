 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_VALERY_SABLIN_DESC:0 "Born in Leningrad amidst the New Years' celebrations of 1939, Valery Sablin was only a child when his family was evacuated eastwards with the shattered remnants of the Presidium, even as his father, a naval officer, sailed forth to meet his doom against the Kriegsmarine. This sacrifice was never lost on Sablin, who had grown up dreaming of the Union he had barely known, and of the Revolution his father's father had fought in. Despite having reservations with Yagoda's leadership, Sablin willingly enlisted into the army as a commissar still, not out of a sense of loyalty to Yagoda's totalitarian empire, but out of perhaps foolish hope that deep within the halls of the few ramshackle military academies that still stood, he would find answers to his questions. Was this really what those who came before him wanted? All he found was disappointment. What few books he could find were censored beyond measure, and he knew the NKVD watched his every step.\n\nWhen the Central Siberian War set the east ablaze, Sablin did his duty, inspiring his men to fight for socialism and equality - the more those under his command looked to him for guidance, the more he wondered if he was truly on the right side. Eventually, the dam broke. Sablin, accompanied by a few loyal soldiers, stormed a radio tower and broadcast a message for all the east to hear. In it, Sablin spoke earnestly of the hardships the people of Russia faced, and spoke of his dream for a truly equal socialist state, free of the terror Yagoda imposed upon the people. He expected no one to listen - but they did. Men and women flocked to join him, the dreamers, the dissidents, and the youths. Now, Sablin and his revolutionaries fight for the future, ready to make the ultimate sacrifice for their dream."
