 POLITICS_ENOCH_POWELL_DESC:0 "The Right Honourable John Enoch Powell was the guardian who quelled the miserable chaos of the 50s. And he strides at the front ever since that fateful day in 1959 to do the righteous thing of salvaging his country. But he is also the man whose feet rest on a torn fabric.\n\nAs a freshly anointed professor, he got embroiled in the horrors of a particular war. The gears of war drove him to Northern Africa and herded him into the clutches of the enemy. Whilst others went underground to fight their own country and conjure the overseers' wrath, Powell - now back home - swore an oath to serve the devil in order to escape the hellish fires of another purgatory. He couldn't prevent the first invasion, he shall not disappoint his homeland yet again. And if that means working under the German boot, it certainly is the most faithful way of guiding England. Thus, he scraped the idiocy off the tainted seats in Parliament by reversing the anarchy of Westminster politics in the late 50s. His solution to thwart any jeopardizing political chaos was the creation of the Royal Party, a political tent-organization with a guaranteed majority in Parliament. A cadre of politicians still nominally loyal to His Majesty assembled under their banner. Just as HMMLR the RP's shattering factionalism has made Powell's life arduous. To the right, the National Front hates him for his reluctance and smear him. To the left, the Reformers despise his stagnancy. Although both misunderstand his actions, they are forced to work together.\n\nSuch is the pain of the virtuous man holding the loose ends of the torn fabric that is England. Enoch Powell is not yet strained to exhaustion, but one day his adversaries - brandishing their knives of idiocy and ignorance - might kick him down the pit..."
