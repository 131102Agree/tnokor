 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 SAM_ANDREY_VLASOV_DESC:0 "The very name of Andrey Andreyevich Vlasov, the turncoat Red Army general, remains a sensitive topic for many Russians. To his few supporters, Vlasov is a modern-day Ivan Kalita, a visionary ruler who wisely submitted to a militarily superior conqueror, then used their patronage to gain a foothold for a powerful and independent Russian state in the future. For most of the former Soviet citizens, however, his name is associated with the most heinous betrayal, comparable to that of Judas. Of course, the real character of Vlasov is far less poetic than that.\n\nIt is hard to say whether the disgraced general was driven by his sincere desire to pierce the Red menace with German bayonets or a simple urge to survive when he allied himself with the Nazis; but whatever motive he had, the German high command never considered him a noteworthy ally, only allowing him to silently gaze upon his country being trampled beneath the German boot from well behind the front lines.\n\nThe last chance for Vlasov to redeem himself both in the eyes of Germans and the eyes of the Russian people appeared during the West Russian War, when his Russian Liberation Army helped turn the tide against the West Russian Revolutionary Front's offensive. Even though it was Vlasov who helped beat back the Soviets, obtaining his own domain in Samara in the aftermath, the Germans still saw him as little more than a dog to be kept on a short chain and closely watched. Humiliated by his masters and unpopular among his once-trustworthy officers, who have started to view his servile demeanor an obstacle to liberating Russia, Vlasov remains a weak and isolated figure who can only hope that reclaiming Russia will absolve his miserable title of a loathsome traitor."
