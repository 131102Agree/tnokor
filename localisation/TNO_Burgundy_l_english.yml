 POLITICS_HEINRICH_HIMMLER_DESC:0 "Heinrich Himmler has been a loyal member of the Nazi Party for decades, having even joined in the abortive Munich Beer Hall Putsch of 1923. And much like the months following the Putsch, the Reich's failures have left Himmler embittered, disillusioned, and more devoted to his ideology than ever before.\n\nWhen the postwar euphoria wore off and the grand projects began to strain German industry, Himmler's faith wavered. When the economy collapsed and the government in Germania was powerless to save it, his faith faltered. And when the Russians nearly took back Moskowien, his faith shattered. This could not be a Jewish plot or Allied sabotage. Nobody stabbed the Reich in the back... except the Nazis themselves.\n\nHimmler became convinced that the Nazi Party had been corrupted and was rotting Germany from the inside out.

However, Speidel got wind of the plot and snuffed it in the cradle with Operation Backfire.\n\nWith word of Himmler's plan leaked, and dozens of divisions captured, it seemed as if the SS was doomed. Hitler, in a rare moment of lucidity, knew that killing Himmler would trigger a civil war, so he offered Himmler a fiefdom far away from Germania, one where he could stay out of Reich politics: SS-Ordensstaat Burgundy. Himmler reluctantly accepted, leaving control of the Deutschen-SS to his loyal lieutenant Reinhard Heydrich, and left for Ost-Paris. But Himmler has only grown more steadfast in his views, and he has not forgotten the injustice against him..."
