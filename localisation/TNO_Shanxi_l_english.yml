POLITICS_FU_ZUOYI_DESC:0 "Fu Zuoyi is the best kind of traitor. The one that deserts to the right side. Never quite the most ideological of men, Fu was through and through a pupil of Yan Xishan's transcentdal philosophy of political thought, and accompanied the warlord on every one of his expeditions, eventually embedding himself into the old Kuomintang. While commanding half a million men and being responsible for a number of early victories against the Japanese, Fu suddenly surrendered his entire army, citing his disillusionment with Chiang Kai-Shek. In that way the prolonged Battle of Xian came to an end with an astounding Japanese victory. \n\nFu's actions guarenteed him a high position in the post-war Japanese order, a position which he was promptly given. While de jure simply governor of Shaanxi province, Fu is now the chief warlord of the region. Perhaps he was given the province to deter him from turning his backs on Japan again. Perhaps they exiled him to central China so he wouldn't fight for his country again. Once traitors betray their nation, there's nothing stopping them from doing it again."
