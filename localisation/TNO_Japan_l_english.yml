 ###LEADER DESCS###
 POLITICS_HIROYA_INO_DESC:0 "Ino Hiroya is not a popular man. Originally a mere representative in the Imperial Diet, Ino skillfully maneuvered his way through the byzantine affairs of Japanese politics to help overthrow Hideki Tojo himself, and then later his political rival Kido Kōichi. But things are never so simple. To bring down such political beasts, Ino had to cut a few backroom deals. More than a few, really. And while those connections initially seemed useful, the obligations on Ino's end have piled up, and he has been forced to work for various special interests, rather than the people of Japan.\n\nIno is a firm believer in the Imperial system, and desires to keep the Emperor above most political discussion. Ino's party, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, is the sole legal party in Japan and encompasses a broad coalition of representatives with various ideologies, but can be corralled into keeping the Chrysanthemum Throne safe and secure from the rough-and-tumble politics of the Diet. However, Ino is rapidly losing control over his own party, and his departure from the office of Prime Minister seems all but inevitable.\n\nMany within the Diet who would like to see Ino ousted much in the same way he once bested Tojo and Kido, including Kido himself, who has found ways to still remain relevant in Japanese politics. If Ino wishes for his ideals to be upheld and for his faction to survive, he must once again find his way safely through Japan's murky politics, as he has done so many times before."
 POLITICS_HIROHITO_DESC:0 "From the smoldering political malaise of the Taisho era rose the phoenix of imperial authority, his majesty, the holy sovereign of Japan, Hirohito. The past four decades have seen Japan grow from a fledgling Pacific empire to the de-facto ruler of the largest ocean on Earth. At the top of it all is him, the descendent of the sun goddess Amaterasu and a proud son of Yamato.\nBorn April 21st 1901, Prince Hirohito was the first of the Taisho Emperor's 4 sons. Hirohito's military education hardened him and, after assuming the regency in 1921, would inspire his future rule. Hirohito would ascend to the throne in 1926 and lead his increasingly militarized empire outwards, grabbing concession in Manchuria, then all of China, and finally coming to dominate all western holdings in the Pacific.\nWith the end of the Great Pacific War, Japan's status as a great power was cemented. The acquisition of large sums of territory brought great riches to the empire and cemented the Emperor's divinity. The Emperor is near exclusively absent from public life, only ever communicating to his subjects through edicts over wire. As the Emperor of the Showa period ages, his empire grows unstable. Soon, great change will come and rattle Japan to its core. What will the people have to hold on to but his divinity, the Emperor?"
 POLITICS_TAKAGI_SOUKICHI_DESC:0 "Soukichi Takagi has two core bases of support that would, at first glance, appear to be completely unrelated: student activists, and the Imperial Japanese Navy. Few can claim such disparate demographics as Takagi can. And yet, with examination, this becomes clear. With a distinguished service record during the Pacific War, which he was initially opposed to, Admiral Takagi has long remained a strong advocate of the IJN's forces (and continued funding). Most notable among his many assignments was heading the carrier group that assisted in the atomic bombing of Pearl Harbor.\n\nLikewise, Takagi enjoys much support from reform-minded members of the Imperial Diet, and student activists, who want to liberalize the economy and expand civil liberties, respectively. To these students, Takagi represents a future of liberty and free expression. And to the members of the Diet, he's a desperately-needed solution to Japan's economic woes.\n\nIn truth, Takagi's support is less stable than it looks. The IJN is only content so long as they are prioritized over the army, no matter who is in charge, and activists are infamously prone to sectarianism. If he is capable of navigating Japanese politics like he once did the waters of the Pacific, and he implements the reforms he wishes to achieve, then Japan's future indeed looks as bright as the rising sun."
 POLITICS_KIDO_KOUICHI_DESC:0 "Many said that Kido Kōichialready had his chance as Prime Minister, and that he wasted it. Ascending to the office following a political coup that Kido, alongside Ino Hiroya, executed against Hideki Tojo, Kido was initially immensely popular. This popularity stemmed not from an actual charisma or capability on Kido's part, but rather from the simple fact that he was not Tojo.\n\nThere were only so many deals that Kido could cut with special interests before Ino gathered the Diet's approval to supplant him. When Ino too fell into this same pit, Kido returned to power. And now that he's back, the Imperial Diet is beginning to remember why they wanted him gone in the first place.\n\nPerhaps one of Kido's few advantages in these times is his close relationship with the Emperor. During the Second World War and for some time after, Kido served as Hirohito's closest advisor, and he continues to hold the utmost concern for the honor of the Chrysanthemum Throne. But with the ever increasing distance between the Emperor and the Imperial Diet, Kido may be losing his edge.\n\nFor Kido Kōichi, surviving this political turmoil means avoiding the same mistakes he made before. And while experience is a valuable thing, the past is as good a predictor of the future as any."
 POLITICS_IKEDA_MASANOSUKE_DESC:0 "Few in Japan thought Ikeda Masanosuke had any chance of becoming Prime Minister. But then, few see things as Ikeda see them. A conservative and staunch Inoite, Ikeda represents the best and worst political instincts of conservatives through history. Leery of radicalism and skeptical of sudden change, the new Prime Minister wishes to uphold the current status quo in Japanese politics.\n\nThis is not to say that Ikeda is blind to the many failings of the Ino era. Corruption and loss of morality have caused wide cracks into the Japanese nation. The smooth cooperation between the Zaibatsus, the Army and the government has broken down. This has lured ambitious men, schemers, opportunists and other types of nogoodniks that wish not to see a healthy Japan, but to make a fortune sifting through its ruins. Public faith in the Diet has been shaken by the ugly sight of the Yokusankai breakdown after Ino's resignation. The nobility has lost faith with their partners in the political sphere. And through all this, foreign observers sharpen their knives in anticipation of a weaker Japan. All this has to be fixed.\n\nA political scientist by formation, and a newspaper editor by trade, Ikeda has never been naive to the grime and muck found in every government's dark corners. Now, he faces the difficult task of cleaning the house he himself has lived in for a decade. His thin coalition of Inoite conservatives, liberals and independents scrutinize his every move. But if not him, then who else? Japan must be dragged out of its darkest hour since the end of the war, and Ikeda knows he's the only shield against radicalism."
 POLITICS_KAYA_OKINORI_DESC:0 "Kaya Okinori likes numbers. People, he could take or leave. At least, this was the initial impression of the Japanese public upon first meeting the bureaucrat turned politician. His ability to channel the Japanese economy into a machine organized for total war raised his status considerably; his simple and amiable, if boring, personality made him look non-threatening. As a result, many reform bureaucrats turned to him as a leader of their faction after Kido Kōichimanaged to bungle his way out of power.\n\nLiking numbers better than people has not stopped Kaya from proving to be a phenomenal negotiator. After seeing the Army pull out every stop to bump Kido from power, Kaya has vowed not to commit the same mistake as his predecessor. As a result, the bureaucrat has slowly, carefully ingratiated himself with the Army. Once the high command deeply feared and distrusted the reform bureaucrat's radical program. Kaya Okinori has managed to convince them that he would defend their interests. As a result, the reform bureaucrats supplanted conservatives as the army's favorite faction. This backing has helped Kaya claw his way to the top, and now the reform bureaucrats have a true shot at changing Japan's direction.\n\nKaya Okinori likes numbers better than people, and his sudden role as a leader for the most powerful faction in Japanese politics is not an easy one for him to fill. The new Prime Minister thus relies on help from members of his faction. But below the surface, the policy consensus of the reform bureaucrat might be more fragile than it seems. Kaya Okinori hopes that his advisors will see reason and help him attain obtainable goals. Returning to the old reform bureaucrat's goal of a society completely subordinated to the government might have unforeseen consequences, after all."
 POLITICS_KAKUEI_TANAKA_DESC:0 "A proverb that is known to every Japanese child says, ''the talented hawk hides its claws''. Tanaka Kakuei, once the ascending dark horse of the Taisei Yokusankai, now the Prime Minister of Japan and always the ''Shadow Shogun'' of the Japanese politics, took this morale to his heart, excelling himself at the art of courtroom intrigues and dealing with the influential people. Constantly having been surrounded by massive corruption scandals for the whole duration of his career, Tanaka always succeeded to emerge unscathed from the situations that would sink a career of other, less unscrupulous, politicians, a quality which he owes to his own willingness to work hard for his ambitions, as well as his important connections to the Zaibatsu and the powerful party groups. Never being truly liked by the system he became a part of, Tanaka's rise to the heights of a Prime Minister was unforeseen and, perhaps, even somewhat unwarranted by the Japanese public, but as the initial favorites of the Yokusankai showed their inability to handle the continuing economic strife and saw their grandiose schemes shattered by the realities of the Japanese byzantine politics, it took little to reserve the empty seat and the favor of the Throne for the perfidious creature of the Zaibatsus.\n\nA beloved candidate of the Japanese patrician families, Prime Minister Tanaka pursues nothing but cementing the dominance of the Zaibatsus and breaking away with the economic dualism between Zaibatsus and Keiretsus that settled in Japan after the World War, of course, in favor of the former side. Forcing his way with the Zaibatsu money and pork barrel projects, Tanaka, however, does not forget about the pleas of a simple Japanese person and fancies himself as the man of the people. Tanaka promises a new era for Japan, the one that will provide a carefree life for Japanese workers and will double their salary in just five years - or else Tanaka will voluntarily step down from power."
 POLITICS_KONOE_FUMIMARO_DESC:0 "Prince Konoe Fumimaro was born into high hopes: an aristocratic upbringing in the Fujiwara clan, a prominent role in Government in diplomatic and then Diet postings, an Order of the Sacred Treasure Award given by the Emperor himself. A product of the old order, Prince Konoe was as regal as he was affable - the charm dazzled the press for a time, and some say he still shines with it. The Konoe star seemed destined for an inexorable rise as Konoe became Prime Minister in 1937, but even Konoe could not controlled the forces at work in interbellum Japanese politics. As the Marco Polo Bridge incident spiralled into one military adventure after another, the smiling Prince lost control of his own Party and Cabinet to trigger-happy militarists, and some say he still carries the old shame of his forced resignation and Long March into obscurity.\n\nSubsequent events proved his worries over the war in China right, but posterity has not been particularly kind to Konoe. Most remember him as the man who watched the sparks fly and the flames rise as Japanese sons died on foreign soil, and did nothing. Now Konoe has been appointed out of desperation by the very Party who pressured him out of his office, and age has sharpened his bitterness - but it has also cleared his sight, and his vision remains undimmed. Recent events have not changed his mind, only convinced him that the old order must be reforged. The Party that betrayed him and the Empire he lost must be woven into the ordered symphony he always wanted Japan to be. The Japanese nation was destroyed by people threatening this balance, but who better than a prince to save it? And Konoe will make it happen by any means necessary: a Fujiwara clansman will only fail once. He will not fail again."
