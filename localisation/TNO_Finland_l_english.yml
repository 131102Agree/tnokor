 POLITICS_KARL_LENNART_OESCH_DESC:0 "Throughout of his life, the ultimate goal of Karl Lennart Oesch was to help his country. Now, as its current leader, that wish can be fulfilled.\n\nIn the interwar years, Oesch kept climbing up the vast hierarchy of the Finnish armed forces, gaining more and more prestige as he did so. As Chief of the General Staff, he closely cooperated with General Mannerheim, but still did not earn his full respect and admiration for his talent. That talent would be shown, however, when the tide of war swept Finland, forcing it to enter the Winter War. Despite Oesch's skill in dealing with the most difficult situations, that war was still lost. This was not the first time the country would fight the Russian communists; twice more, in the Eastern Front of World War Two and the West Russian War, Oesch would lead his men into battle. In fact, his incredible success in defeating the WRRF offensive into Karelia, and ever retaking the Onega region, would boost his popularity and influence.\n\nThe glory of his nation was not meant to last long. Following the West Russian War, instability dominated the Finnish political scene, and Oesch had only option: send in the army. A provisional military regime was established under one of the country's most famous generals. The government's popularity was at an all-time low, and another hit to the country would come with the Crash of the 50s. Oesch had worked hard to approach Germany, but that seemed to massively backfire, as the economic depression of the Reich took Finland down with it. And so, the military leader of the nation now has a terrible situation to face: will, amidst the nation's decline, the voices of the people be heard and democracy preserved?"
