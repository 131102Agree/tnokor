#Leader Descriptions
 POLITICS_Abd_al_Karim_Qasim_DESC:0 "During his tenure as prime minister of the Republic of Iraq, Abd al-Karim Qasim has earned the title of al-Za'im, the Leader, and even his numerous enemies have to recognize that it is well deserved. Born into a mixed Sunni and Shiite family, Qasim took quickly to the military, serving as a rebel officer during the Anglo-Iraqi War. During the conflict, Qasim became known for his charisma and cunning as a leader, soon rising through the ranks of the Iraqi army and creating a network of allies among the rising pan-Arabist cliques. At the same time, he kept up good relations with the Italian occupiers, careful to work with both camps while truly belonging to neither.\n\nThe unpopular Golden Square puppet regime was finally toppled by the revolution of July 14th, 1958. Qasim established him as a "moderate" and "reasonable" voice of the revolution, and maintained his Italian contacts throughout. The revolutionaries had grand projects of pan-Arab unity and a broad revolt against Italian imperialism - projects which clearly became doomed as the many different factions turned to infighting and the grand army of Fascism gathered on Iraq's borders. Qasim led a military revolt against both sides, and opened negotiations with Rome, through which he was allowed to remain as prime minister of an independent and republican Iraq in exchange for allowing a small Italian garrison and renouncing all dreams of Arab unity - a deal which Qasim was more than happy to take.\n\nFrom there on, Qasim began shaping Iraq in his vision. Pushing progressive and reformist policies, the new prime minister began to carry out land reform, social reform and education campaigns, with the goal of bringing Iraq into the modern age as a modern nation, even if one watched by Italy.  Though bold, his reforms have also been cautious, for fear of provoking the many enemies and false friends which wait in the shadows. And they are numerous indeed - Ba'athists and Nasserists which Qasim once betrayed and perhaps others, even more insidious, wait in the shadows, plotting and scheming the downfall of the al-Za'im."
