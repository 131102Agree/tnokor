 POLITICS_REICHSKOMMISSAR_JOSIAS_DESC:0 "Josias, Erbprinz zu Waldeck und Pyrmont was raised in power and nobility, but was powerless to stop his family's noble titles and privileges from being stripped away when the German Republic was proclaimed. He joined the Nazi Party in the late 1920s, quickly falling in with the SS and steadily climbing its ranks. Josias soon developed a reputation for being meticulous and fiercely devoted to the letter of the law, even prosecuting Buchenwald camp commandant Karl-Otto Koch for embezzlement of funds. By the time the West Russian War came to a close, Josias had a comfortable job as the SS High Police Commissioner in Wartheland, and he largely remained above suspicion regarding Himmler's failed SS coup. In order to keep his reputation airtight while serving as Himmler's eyes and ears in the Reich's eastern peripheries, the two engineered a falling-out that culminated in Josias publicly denouncing the SS and tearing up his membership card.\n\nWhen it came to light that Reichskommissariat Kaukasien was overrun with partisans and needed a new Reichskommissar, it was easy for Josias to sway the Führer with his excellent work record and sterling reputation. But less than a week after arriving in Tiflis, Josias was captured by a branch of the Transcaucasian Soviet partisan group and gruesomely tortured for three days. He remembered every bit of pain he suffered, as well as every face that watched. After he was finally rescued, he put his plan for "pacification" into place. Highways and cities were fortified, natives were forcibly relocated, and uncooperative regions were indiscriminately firebombed. Josias also began filling the bureaucracy and garrison with loyal SS members, and quietly rejoined the organization (though he considers it an insult his original membership number wasn't restored). He still sends his resource quotas to Germania so they don't complain, but there are those who still believe that he really takes his orders from Ost-Paris."
