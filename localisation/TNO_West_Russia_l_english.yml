 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_KLIMENT_VOROSHILOV_DESC:0 "For Kliment Yefremovich Voroshilov, the war never truly ended. Proudly serving the Soviet country even since its foundation, Voroshilov brought many victories in the name of the Communist party, with his defense of Tsaritsyn, which would be later named in his honor, being the most famed one. For his valiant feats and simple proletarian character, Voroshilov became one of the most mythologized figures among the Soviet people and quickly rose up as the First Marshal under Bukharin. Even though he couldn't save his Motherland when the Germans invaded in 1941, he never gave up in his attempts to expel the Fascists from the Russian soil, even after the people of Muscovy and Ukraine submitted to the whim of the Hun. In his exile beyond the A-A Line, Voroshilov succeeded to amass the remained Red forces of West Russia under his banner and to strike a heavy blow against Germany and her lapdogs in Moskowien. So began the legendary West Russian War, which saw the WRRF almost on the verge of victory, but later saw its efforts undermined by the reactionary Russian collaborators and traitors within the Front.\n\nEven in his defeat, the resolve of the Marshal remained unbreakable and he never lost his hope that he will eventually see the Red Banner over the Kremlin once again. The old Klim remains a popular figure among the people of Arkhangelsk, but the long years of never-ending struggle and long melancholy for his lost Motherland have not spared his health. His authority still holds the remnants of the Soviet country together, but as his subordinate Generals obtain more and more power within their domain and seek to change the Front in their own image, fiercely competing with each other for the influence over the country, who can say what future unfolds for the West Russian Front after Voroshilov dies..."
 POLITICS_GEORGY_ZHUKOV_DESC:0 "From the streets of Voroshilovgrad to the shores of Khalkhin Gol, from the outskirts of Leningrad to the forests of West Russia, in every battleground he fought, Georgy Konstantinovich Zhukov demonstrated himself as an exceptional leader and stood out as an example to respect and follow from his peers and subordinates alike. Serving the Motherland with dignity and honor since its foundation, Zhukov was among the cohort of Soviet generals who have not surrendered to the advance of the Hun or abandoned their oath to the Soviet Union, and became one of the leading generals of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, the one which almost brought the Reich to its knees.\n\nEven though the Front lost the battle, it did not lose its sacred war against the Fascist horde. The Front will rise anew - but will it learn from its past failures? Marshal Zhukov adamantly believes in the Communist cause and deeply admires the sacrifices the Soviet people took to preserve their country, but at the same time, he often expressed his doubts in the efficiency of the Front organization and went as far as suggesting that the Soviet leadership moved too far away from the working people it claims to represent. Zhukov's too independent position caused some hardliner generals to question his trustworthiness and even his loyalty to the Front for a man of his responsibilities.\n\nThe rumors of his political unreliability have not walked past the ears of the Arkhangelsk leadership, but his authority among the Red Army and sympathies from the common people were too significant to even consider merely discarding him. Following several unfortunate confrontations between Zhukov and other generals, he was sent to oversee the extraction of oil in the region of Ukhta, where he could put skills to use while keeping himself busy to affect the politics of the Front. Should the Front face turmoil, however, the marshal won't let himself to be quiet..."
 POLITICS_MIKHAIL_TUKHACHEVSKY_DESC:0 "Mikhail Nikolayevich Tukhachevsky was always considered an eccentric, if talented, member of the Soviet High Command. A former noble, he turned against the conformity of his class and joined the Bolshevik party in their crusade against the old order. Victory after victory, every conquered city he dedicated to the cause of revolution and Vladimir Lenin paved the extraordinary career for the so-called 'Red Bonaparte', despite his young age.\n\nFollowing the Soviet defeat against the Nazi tide, Tukhachevsky was one of the generals who formed the basis of the WRRF leadership, but soon the self-willed Marshal grew to disdain his colleagues for their weakness and incompetence that led Russia to be defeated by Nazis in the first place. Being concerned with his influence on the Front politics, the Front leadership granted Tukhachevsky with a small domain in Plesetsk, where he could stay away from the intrigues of Arkhangelsk and organize the defensive frontier against the enemies from the West.\n\nA proponent of a revolutionary offensive war ever since his maturity as a Bolshevik military theorist, Tukhachevsky for a long time opposed the attempts of Bukharin to appease the enemies of the world proletariat, such as Germany and Japan, and tried to resist his ruinous reforms in the military complex, only for his voice to fall on deaf ears and his efforts to negated during the catastrophic course of the war with the Nazi Reich. Being a witness to the failed attempts of Bukharin's government to placate and defeat the bourgeois powers without a needed revolutionary vigor and determination, Marshal Tukhachevsky, a passionate warrior he is, only grew more convinced in his notion of the Red Army as the main instrument of a political change.\n\nIf the Soviet Union is bound to return under Tukhachevsky, it will return as an armed camp, eternally vigilant against its numerous enemies, with every cog inside its state machine rotated towards the final victory."
 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_ALTUNIN_DESC:0 "Alexander Terentyevich Altunin was never the most proud or notable general of the West Russian Revolutionary Front. A specialist in civil defense and logistics, he performed his craft without complaint from the Great Patriotic War to the West Russian War, organizing air defense, industrial coordination, and, when the line simply couldn't hold any longer, ensuring that the columns of refugees fleeing eastward were protected from Luftwaffe pilots aiming to score easy kills.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Front, Altunin once more organized an orderly retreat, bringing the Fourth Army back to Arkhangelsk to await further instruction, serving as a bulwark against factionalism and conflict within the Front. While in Arkhangelsk, by Voroshilov's side, Altunin spearheaded the first initiatives to oppose the German bombers, building bunkers, securing emergency food rations from Syktyvkar and Yugra, and working out mutually beneficial deals with the Free Aviators. While Tukhachevsky is the shield and sword of the front, and Zhukov is its fiery, industrial backbone, Altunin is its steady, strong, and quiet heart.\n\nThis attitude of quiet competence and his more apolitical and pragmatic nature has drawn Voroshilov's attention to Altunin, who he views as the 'safest' and most orderly leader of the Front. Altunin may not be a legendary hero or firebrand revolutionary, but he is a true believer, and one of the few men that the ailing Great Marshal has nothing but complete trust and confidence in."
