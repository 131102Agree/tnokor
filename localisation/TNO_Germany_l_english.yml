### LEADER DESCRIPTIONS ###
 POLITICS_ADOLF_HITLER_DESC:0 "How does one begin to define Adolf Hitler, Führer and Reichskanzler of the Greater German Reich, the undisputed tyrant of 19 countries, the architect of Welthauptstadt Germania, Supreme Commander of the Wehrmacht, Führer of the National Socialist German Workers' Party, and Time Magazine's Man of the Year in 1938, 1946, and 1961?\n\nA man of humble beginnings, the son of Austrian Innkeepers, he was educated in Munich and Vienna, and served with distinction with the German Army during the First World War. His rise to power was meteoric, none can deny, and even failed attempts like the Beer Hall Putsch served only to further his ambitions. His combination of violence and showmanship drove the communists and democrats out of the Reichstag and placed him into its highest office. Under his leadership, Germany broke the chains of the Versailles Treaty, developed a terrifying new military, and forced the other nations of Europe to their knees until the Swastika flew over all of Europe, from the shores of the Atlantic Ocean to the Black Sea. Under his guidance, the Reich built such wonders as Atlantropa and Germania, and under his watchful eye, the Undesirables of Europe were viciously exterminated and fed to the flames.\n\nBut the lord and master of all Germany, of all Europe between the Urals and the Pyrenees, has grown old. Where his voice could once command a crowd's rapt attention there is now only quiet rasping, and a cold calculating mind of steel has gone to rust. The hands that penned Mein Kampf constantly tremble now, as he adds the final touches to a watercolor of those long-dead faces slipping from his memory. The greatest conqueror the world has ever known since Alexander and Napoleon is an old and frail man. In 1962, he is 73 years of age, and some dare to whisper that he is not long for this world. The fear of all the world is that once the Führer's funeral pyre is lit, it will spread the great conflagration of war all across Europe once more."
 REICHSTAG_EMERGENCY_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "The Führer has tragically passed, and the Reich was shocked by the news. After all, who could expect such an invincible man to die?\n\nNot the Reichstag, apparently.\n\nDespite the Führer's clear designation as to who his successor will be, many within the government are up in arms. The reformists, conservatives, hardliners, and fanatics are all at each other's throats, and all pretenses of a peaceful and orderly transfer of power are rapidly vanishing. As a result, a group of fence-sitters, no-name bureaucrats, and other Reichstag members too unpopular to be courted by any faction have bounded together to declare themselves the official intermediary executive branch until the new Führer's inauguration, as per a constitution that everyone had collectively ignored for the past thirty years.\n\nThe main contenders for the Führership have all paid little attention the emergency council, viewing them as benchwarmers at best and insubordinate traitors at worst. The only light side is that their presence has given a shadow of stability in Germania, stopping the city from spiraling into chaos so that a more competent leader can (hopefully) take charge. They may have saved Rome from burning, but they are content to fiddle as the rest of the empire goes up in flames."
 POLITICS_HANS_SPIEDEL_DESC:0 "Long has Speidel served proudly in the Wehrmacht and long has the nation been proud to host him. First rising to fame after narrowly staving off a Civil War in the 50s thanks to his quick coup against the SS in the east during the heights of the West Russian War, where he was awarded the Knight's Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds for gallantry in battle. A rising star, he further rode off the popularity of his old leader and personal friend, Rommel and became one of the most beloved figures in Germany. Later Speidel challenged the Reich's many militarists, namely Ferdinand Schörner, sabotaging Schörner's career and for the second time in Speidel's life preventing a coup in the Reich when he prevented Schörner from taking control of the Wehrmacht for his own gains.\n\nStill, Speidel is not a politician and feels strongly against the increasing ties between the Wehrmacht and the government. Fearing military control of the Reich would destroy it, he has refused all attempts to bribe and cajole him into one of the various factions in the Reich and continues to state that as a soldier his duty will always be to the people. While noble, this means that Speidel is a small island in a swirling sea, and every day the tide comes ever higher."
 POLITICS_SPEER_GERMANY_DESC:0 "Many things are said of Albert Speer, yet none can deny his ambition.\n\nUnlike many others, he did not join the NSDAP that fateful day in 1931 for the late Führer's fiery rhetoric. It was Adolf Hitler's calm and collected speech given during a rally in Berlin that intoxicated the young architect, leading him to join the Party the year after.\n\nWhat started as a favor to a fellow member became a recommendation to Joseph Goebbels; the recommendation became a commission to renovate the local NSDAP headquarters. Before long, he had drawn the personal interest of the Führer. Hitler became a passionate admirer of his vision, and together they drafted plans of a new Germany.\n\nBy the war's end, Speer was a close friend of the Führer, presided over his own ministry and touted a reputation as the man who transformed the Reich's economy into a war-winning machine. No matter the cost of life, the dream of a new Germany had been realized. Reputation is rarely truth - but he made sure that everyone knew of his.\n\nIt was in the midst of Germania's construction that the economy crashed, and his lofty dreams with it. Pinning the blame was easy. Slavery, the very system Speer created to win the war, doomed Germany in peace. It was an unprecedented disaster - one that Speer could not ignore. The Reich and Volk deserved greatness. His dreams deserved reality. Reform was necessary.\n\nYears of open criticism of NSDAP policy followed, and he soon found himself somewhere unexpected once again: as the figurehead of the largest reform movement Germany had seen in decades. Speer's ambitious goals and reputation as a dissenter enveloped countless of young dreamers and old rivals around him in a political maelstrom unlike any other.\n\nAnd as he now walks this perilous tightrope he crafted, he balances not only his own future but also that of the Reich."
 POLITICS_HERMANN_GORING_DESC:0 "Göring once made a public challenge that if any Allied bomber dare reach the Reich that forever after he would be known as Hermann Meier. The success of Nazism in the World War proved his bluff wise, and Göring was soon sure to cut himself a piece of the great pie the victors greedily dove into once the Allies lie destroyed.\n\nUsing a mix of a somewhat political able mind and several excessive uses of blunt force, namely in the deployment of thugs, militias and 'patriots' to harass and drive off any threats to his power, Göring has centered himself as the sole politician in the Reich who truly listens to the pleas of the soldiery. Seeing no other way to power, he has surrounded himself by uniformed sycophants who have convinced the aging Führer that the only way for the Reich to prosperity would be through the utter destruction of its enemies.\n\nNow, Göring goose-step arm and arm on what many consider a rapid road to the destruction of the Reich. That is assuming he is soon stopped however, for one can only imagine what may happen once Göring sets his sights overseas..."
 POLITICS_MARTIN_BORMANN_DESC:0 "Nazism has always relied primarily on two things: nationalistic sympathies towards one's own nation, and a central strongman smart enough to trample his enemies in the political game and sway the masses. None of Hitler's potential successors embodied this more than Martin Bormann; who learned closely from The Führer in his time as his secretary and strives to emulate him in every way. In doing so; Bormann has honed in on the nationalistic sentiments of the population to convince them that he is the only man in the Reich able to keep them safe and their nation secure. Often calling himself the 'Second Hitler' to cheering masses as he fed them exactly what they wanted.\n\nThe political arena has proven to be less of a battlefield and more of a shooting gallery to Bormann as well. While Bormann oft paints himself as an anti-intellectual and a simpler man to the masses, in the Reichstag he has proven himself to be a fierce negotiator, power player and deceiver to many. While Germany is divided between himself and the others who dared fight him, the Reichstag has always been firmly under his boot. Truly, if politics could win wars, then Bormann would have long ago conquered the world."
