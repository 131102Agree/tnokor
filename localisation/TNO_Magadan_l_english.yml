 POLITICS_MIKHAIL_MATKOVSKY_DESC:0 "In so many ways, Mikhail Alexeevich Matkovsky displayed a form of Russian fascism that contrasts itself against Rodzaevsky's formulation. Where Rodzaevsky was dogmatic, he was pragmatic. Where Rodzaevsky was a skilled, fiery orator, he was the negotiator, using his tact and political acumen to sway political enemies to his side. Where Rodzaevsky praised the anti-Semitic initiatives from the Blackshirts, Matkovsky despised their thuggery. For a brief moment, their goals aligned. The results of their cooperation saw the membership RFP rise and peak, as more and more Russian émigrés saw the appeal of fascism.\n\nThen the Great Patriotic War erupted. With the Germans waging a conflict of extermination upon Russia, the differences between these two simmered. Despite Hitler's destructive, genocidal intent, Rodzaevsky sought his support, dreaming of a Russia free from Bolshevism at last. Matkovsky had no such illusions. Germany's war against the Soviet Union, and therefore against Russia, lay bare their racial hatred against Russians. No matter what appeal the RFP can garner, the Nazis did not factor any independent Russia into their plans. However, true to Matkovsky's tact, he and his clique remained silent and bided their time, growing their power in the intervening years.\n\nWhen the time came, they seized the city of Magadan from Rodzaevsky, driving the loyalists out and officially splitting the party. Now in charge of his own domain, Matkovsky seeks to save Russia from her ruin. The means to this end lay across the ocean, past the Japanese: America. However, even for an experienced negotiator such as Matkovsky, convincing any foreign power is a difficult task; yet, he will not let mere doubt stop him."
