 POLITICS_BABA_MASAO_DESC:0 "The British belongings in Borneo always held a special place in the Japanese plans in their quest of the Asian dominance. For a time, the oil resources of the island were objects of temptation for the economic giants of the Empire and its strategic position amidst the shipping routes between East Asia and Australia proved to be invaluable for reinforcing the Japanese units across the battlefields in Asia. After the short and triumphant campaign of the Japanese forces in Borneo, the former British territories were reorganized as a domain for the military, to be held by a strong-willed and determined commander. This man was Baba Masao, the general of the 37th Army, once fancied as the Borneo Defence Army.\n\nA hereditary army officer and student of the Prussian discipline, Baba saw his career's upheaval during the Japanese war in Indonesia, paving his way through victories against the Americans. Subsequently, he became the commander of the garrison in Borneo and its military governor, a post he held ever since for his past glory, remaining unchallenged by his rivals and enviers. Befitting for a Japanese military ruler, Baba ruled with an iron fist, not shying away from any brutal methods to suppress any attempts at resistance and enforce his will. A believer in the Japanese supremacy above everything else, he furthered the Japanese assimilation policies in the region and turned it into a playground for the Japanese monopolies each seeking to get their share of riches from the island.\n\nAs North Borneo was turned into a heavily militarized and entretched zone following the course of the war and its aftermath, the former British protectorate became the outpost for the Army in maritime Southeast Asia. Maintaining its strong presence at the border with Indonesia, the 37th Army under Baba serves as a reinforcer of the Japanese hold in the Greater Sunda Islands and as a 'supplemental' force to the collaborationist governments, should they fail to hold the anti-Sphere insurgencies by themselves."
