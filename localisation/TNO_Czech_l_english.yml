POLITICS_LUTZ_GRAF_KROSIGK_DESC:0 "A conservative lawyer and disgraced former finance minister, Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk is not the first man one would expect to be running any part of the Reich's vast territories. Appointed as Reich Minister of Finance by the hated von Papen, he managed to hold his position into and through the National Socialist takeover through a combination of keeping his head down and blindly following any order from Hitler, along with steadily towing the party line. Through his seeming competence at keeping the economy together, he managed to win the Führer's trust and respect enough to save him from execution after the economic crash of the 1950s. Hitler's respect, however, could not save his job.\n\nDemoted from his post as Reich Minister, he was bounced around numerous departments, becoming a wandering bureaucrat shuffling papers. Finally, the Führer showed mercy upon him and sent him to become the Reichsprotektor of Böhmen-Mahren, with the understanding that he is on thin ice.\n\nKrosigk enters the Protektorat's political scene with a mixture of horror and determination to show the Führer what he's made of. Naturally, Böhmen-Mahren is a wreck of a nation, with partisans regularly destroying whatever's left of the failing infrastructure. It will take some work and reform to get the Protektorat up and running again. Of course, Germany may not like that reform, but what they don't know can't hurt them."
