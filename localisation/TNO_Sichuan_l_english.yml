 POLITICS_TIAN_SONGYAO_DESC:0 "It's not only clear to his immediate subordinates that Tian Songyao is a thoroughly indifferent man. Fears have sprouted concerning his potential death due to the fact that the tired warlord has not made a public appeareance in weeks. However, Tian Songyao is alive and well, as his favorite concubine and his accountant know all too well. Every few months, an inordinate amount of money leaves the bank, and nobody says a word, for they assume the next banker knows something of it. And every few months, Tian's accountant takes in a few more bundles of cash. \n\nHowever, few blink much of an eye.

Very little information about positive developments aside from a few economic reports come out of sleepy Sichuan, but Tian is not so indifferent for no reason. After failing to stop the Communist Party of China in their Long March north, Tian fell out of favor with Chiang Kai-Shek and was left in minor commanding positions. Growing tired of losing battles during the war, Tian betrayed the KMT to Reorganized Chinese forces by fomenting a revolt within the Sichuan Clique. \n\nWhile he failed to secure the west and dislodge Wenhui, he succeeded in taking the populous and industrious east. In the end, it turned out this all went well, but the spoils of victory are entirely disinteresting to the man who has gained the moniker of "Winter Melon". Of course, these are all unsubstantiated, considering most aren't even sure the man is alive anymore. "
