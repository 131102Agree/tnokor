 #Leader descriptions
 POLITICS_GG_CHIESA_DESC:0 "Governor Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa is a man whose meteoric career left many stunned, and many more envious. A decorated veteran of WWII, Dalla Chiesa asked to be transferred from the Regio Esercito to the Carabinieri to follow the footsteps of his father, himself a general of the Carabinieri. After the end of the war, he was assigned to the newly acquired Italian territories in the Levant, where he demonstrated his skill and valor in the investigations and repression of the various terrorist and paramilitary groups that plagued the region. As arrest followed arrest, he quickly rose through the ranks of the Carabinieri, and was noticed by Galeazzo Ciano.\n\nWhen it was time to assign a new governor to the Levant, the new Duce, instead of choosing another old fascist, picked the young general as successor. The choice was controversial, as it was well known that Dalla Chiesa has little sympathy for fascism - but in his yet short tenure, the Carabiniere general managed to bring a semblance of peace to the Levant, even if he had to use unorthodox methods. Rome expected results, and that is what Dalla Chiesa gave them - extremist insurgent groups were targeted by repression, while a semblance of a truce was brokered among those who were willing to negotiate. However, the fate of the Levant still hangs in the balance.\n\nTo Dalla Chiesa, it is clear Italian rule over the region isn't going to last, and some type of agreement between Italy and the many peoples of the Levant has to be found unless the area is to be thrown again into chaos. The Carabiniere governor has managed to return something resembling peace to the Levant - how long that will last, is still to be seen."
