 POLITICS_NIKOLAI_AVERIN_DESC:0 "Know, oh listener, that after the fall of the Soviet Union and its armies, as the lands of Russia trembled under the German might, there was an age undreamed of, when warring states lay spread across Russia like blue mantles beneath the stars - Vologda, Onega, Arkhangelsk, Komi with its fledgling democracy and its struggling paramilitaries, Samara with its collaborators guarded by Germans. But the proudest state of all was Moskowien, reigning supreme over the Russian West. Hither came Nikolay Stepanovich Averin, from Gorky, black-hearted, sullen-eyed, gun in hand, a thief, a reaver, a slayer, with gigantic ambitions and gigantic mirth, to overwhelm the Nazi garrisons of Moskowien under the treads of his tanks.\n\nThe master of terror in Western Russia, Averin first became infamous among the Germans in the time of the West Russian War, as he led the fiercest tank army under Voroshilov's command. In the chaotic days following the conflict, Averin gathered the bulk of what was left of the Russian armored forces for a last stand near Gorky, where he repelled the assaulting Wehrmacht to allow the remaining Russian troops to retreat safely. After the collapse of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, Gorky was left standing, and Averin stood with her.\n\nOver the years, Averin's tank fleet has been both his greatest strength and his greatest weakness. To keep it operational, he soon had to resort to large scale raids into German territory, reaping from the vast and overstretched territories of the German settlers all the fuel, parts and prisoners he needed to keep his army operational. Soon, Averin started to enjoy his new life as a raider, and soon all ideological pretense was lost - the only thing Averin cares about now is to crush the Germans, see them driven before him, and hear the lamentations of their women!"
