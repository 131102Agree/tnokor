POLITICS_MASANOBU_TSUJI_DESC:0 "Tsuji's past is shrouded in myth, created by the terror surrounding the man. Depending on who you ask, he was either the slaughterer of hundreds of thousands or the general who won the war through unorthodox means. \n\nTo the peasent, he's a man who ignored due process and executed anyone suspecting of taking part in the resistance. To the discharged army man, he's an insane general who threw human waves at a resolute army. To the current army man, there is no one else they would serve under, in his infinite benevolence and strangeness. \n\nThe hearsay dictates that he was indeed responsible in large part for certain military operations, and went on to serve in some particular instituitions and organizations in the Japanese apparatus. The psychologist would say that Tsuji had a greed for power, and needed to elevate himself to a seat on the Imperial Diet. The loyalist would say that Tsuji had great plans for Japan, and it was only the Chinese collaborators and communists that compromised his plan and forced him to lose his election. The traditionalist would say the emperor personally exiled Tsuji for the rumors across the empire. The Pan-Asianist would say that they heard he walked through Manchukuo and Mengjiang, taking his time to tour the glory of the empire on his way to his new appointment. \n\nThe Muslim would say that he came to the west to torture the Prophet's Followers and put Ma Bufang to the stake. Tsuji would say that he was simply serving his duty. The western observer would watch and say that there must be an end to the conflict in the northwest soon, while the local would say that the torment of the iron hand never seems to fade. To all, however, one thing is in agreement; The Mad General prepares for war. "
