 POLITICS_GAO_ZONGWU_DESC:0 "If there is one man that embodies the Chinese spirit of the century of humiliation, it is Gao Zongwu. Born in the dimming light of the Qing, his relatives noted his shrewdness, sure he was to become a politician. His future was made brighter by the privilege of studying in Japan, and Gao became one of the leading experts on trans-Yellow Sea relations.\n\nAfter being introduced to the future president of the Republican Republic, Wang Jingwei, Gao was invited to join the government. By his 20s, Gao led the Asian department of the foreign service. When the Japanese attacked at Marco Polo, Gao expressed his desire for peace. As a close colleague of Wang, Gao joined the recently formed Reformed Government of China.\n\nThe Japanese decimated China, but a power vacuum remained. With no clear, strong head to lead the Reformed Government, officials scrambled for a spot at the top. Eventually, rivaling political factions put their fists down and decided to install a compromise candidate. Immediately, they turned to Gao. Not the most assertive or even strong leader, they hoped he would serve as a figurehead for their own acts and movements.\n\nGao defied all expectations. Perhaps the first leader in Chinese history to encourage the triumph of democracy over dictatorship and freedom over the boot, Gao has done what his predecessors haven't. His great reforms have pushed China to a future not defined by its failures, a truly free future."
