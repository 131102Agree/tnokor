 POLITICS_JAWAHARLAL_NEHRU_DESC:0 "Jawaharlal Nehru is a man who has seen much regarding India: its birth, its struggle, and its growth into one of the foremost secondary global powers. Born to the prestigious Nehru family of patriots, he succeeded has father as President of the Indian National Congress, and quickly became friends with two other leaders of the nationalist organization: Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose. Nehru was present throughout much of the formative days of India, serving as the next in line to Gandhi's legacy, behind Bose. However, the friendship of the two younger patriots was not meant to last.\n\nWhen the Germans marched on Britain, Bose's Indian National Army descended upon Assam and Bengal, valiantly advancing against colonial forces that dared to fight on. However, the war took a turn for the worse in late 1943, when Bose declared that anyone who had cooperated with the British was no longer welcomed in the Azad Hind. This was an outrage to Nehru; would he be sent to his death for endorsing the Gandhian ideals of peace? He would not sit silently and accept fate, but he would fight on! On January 26th, 1944, the day of Indian independence, Nehru declared the rebirth of a nation in Bombay, with centuries of chains destroyed, as the Republic of India would fight for its freedom against Britain, and, more controversially, Japan. What came next was a 9-year conflict between brothers resulting in an inconclusive ceasefire and over a million dead between the two.\n\nNow, less than a decade later, Nehru is dying. the first prime minister, the founding father of the Republic, is nearing his last breath, as the Mahatma did nearly a decade ago. Afterwards, what happens to the INC, and, perhaps, India as a whole, is in the hands of Vishnu."
