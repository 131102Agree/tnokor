 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_DMITRY_KARBYSHEV_DESC:0 "Dmitry Mikhaylovich Karbyshev's story is a tragic one, full of betrayal, loss, and fury. He first fought for the Tsar in the Great War, joined the Red Guards in the Civil War, and returned to duty when the Motherland was invaded once more. Captured by the Germans and sent to a string of concentration camps, Karbyshev was beaten, tortured, and left to die, but he never lost hope in his people. Eventually, he and a few others escaped the death camps and fled east, past the Union's weakening grip and into the arms of Lazar Kaganovich's West Siberian People's Republic.\n\nEmbittered by years of suffering, Karbyshev resolved to never let Russia see such torment again. He began planning for what he called the §RGreat Trial§!, the coming final conflict with Germany that would seal Russia's fate. Gathering many like-minded comrades to his cause, he soon rebelled against Kaganovich and seized Omsk, turning the city into a fortress where he could prepare in peace. Karbyshev proclaimed the rule of the All-Russian Black League, the only organization he saw fit to guide Russia through what lay ahead.\n\nBut time wore on, and distrust grew among his once-loyal officers. Now he can do naught but watch the vultures circling above, and weep at how those he hoped to save fight each other instead of the enemy. The §RGreat Trial§! looms ever closer, and unless someone worthy takes up his mantle, Dmitry Karbyshev fears Russia will be doomed when it arrives."
