 THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "A new order has descended upon Europe. With the rise of Germany in the 1930s and her triumph over her enemies in the following decade, the world has been forever and irreversibly changed. The borders of the world have been redrawn, and yesterday's empires are now dust under the boot of the victors, who have already turned on themselves. As a German lands on the moon, an assassin strikes at Hitler, a bomb goes off in London, and the Japanese begin a radical new economic plan in China."
