 POLITICS_SIBERIAN_SOVIET_DESC:0 "In the wake of the Union's collapse, the people of the Angara's basin founds themselves free from the authority of Moscow. The first thing they did, in a true socialist fashion, was to assemble a committee. Many of the regional institutions were functioning without Moscow's oversight, and with some rationing and belt-tightening, many of the goods that it imported from elsewhere in the union could be forgone or replaced with local substitutes. Contact with the remnants of the Soviet government in western Russia had been lost, and they were hesitant to acknowledge the "democratic" provisional government of the Central Siberian Republic and the tyrannical regime of Genrikh Yagoda alike, forming self-defense militia squads fighting for their freedoms with blood. And thus, influenced by the influx of once ostracized anarchist thinkers from the farthest parts of the Soviet Union, they proclaimed their independence as the Siberian Anarchist Soviet, a self-governing ruling body with equal representation for all major towns and industrial unions.\n\nAs their position became secure from the foreign threats, the Siberian Black Army, the military force of the free communes of the shores of Iya, became one the leading voices in the Soviet and declared the militarized anarchism as its main platform. The militia service became an essential part of every man and woman of the Free Territory, and the armed formations of free communes are assembled not merely as a means of self-defense for the free communities, but also as a means of spreading the liberating ideology abroad.\n\nThe spreading militarization of the anarchist society, seemingly contradictory to anarchist ideals, caused surprisingly little tensions between the Army and the Soviet, but many of commoners fear that the ambitions of the Black Army, the protector of the independence of Siberian communes, will eventually become the undoing of their own freedoms."
