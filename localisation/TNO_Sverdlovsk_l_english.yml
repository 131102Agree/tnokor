 POLITICS_KONSTANTIN_ROKOSSOVSKY_DESC:0 "Unlike many other men, Konstantin Konstantinovich Rokossovsky stayed faithful to the Soviet Motherland no matter what, even to this very day. Being born in the days of the Tsar to a family of Polish gentry, he had to suffer a very poor life as a child. It was only logical that he turned to the Bolshevik Party, and soon became one of the most distinguished and well-known commanders of the Soviet Union, a distinguished gentleman and officer whose military record was nothing short of brilliant. After two decades of serving in the Red Army, the house of cards would crumble, the USSR would collapse, and Rokossovsky would have to adapt to a completely new environment. As his 3rd Army fled from the invading Germans and reached the Urals, he was welcomed with open arms by Lazar Kaganovich, and so he joined the West Siberian People's Republic.\n\nHowever, the alliance of Kaganovich and his generals, full of distrust and bitter competition, was a fragile one, and would inevitably fall apart. Western Siberia would battle for its survival, against all odds, as the Germans continued their relentless bombing raids and rifts between its top leaders and generals only grew and grew, to a point when they could not be mended. Seeing the People's Republic was a sinking ship as Karbyshev seized the city of Omsk and Kaganovich showing its disdain by his inaction, Rokossovsky would quickly gather his 3rd Army in the city of Sverdlovsk to form a provisional military government led by himself and backed by a formidable force. While disillusioned with his former party superiors in Tyumen, Rokossovsky has not abandoned his cause of the Soviet Union reunification, even if it will be driven by its loyal and impartial military, born and taught in the best traditions of the Russian and Soviet art of war and serving the working people above the bureaucrats. The harsh service and old age took a considerable toll on Marshal Rokossovsky's health, but his resolve remains persistent in the desperate times. Even if he won't live to see the Red Army marching in the Red Square once again, he can rely on the old friends and comrades to continue his mission with dignity."
