 POLITICS_VLADIMIR_KIRPICHNIKOV_DESC:0 "Before the Second World War, Vladimir Vasilevich Kirpichnikov was nothing more than an ordinary commander in the Red Army. Many thought he was destined to die as a hero of the Soviet Union, bravely fighting against the enemy, but that was not to be his fate. In the few months of fighting Russia experienced, before collapsing into chaos and warlordism, Kirpichnikov would lead the 43rd Rifle Division into battle against the Finns in the Karelian Isthmus. The superior enemy tactics would cause the Soviet front to collapse, and the 43rd Division was almost destroyed. Kirpichnikov was captured during the chaotic retreat, and would be interrogated and interned by the Finnish Army.\n\nThe major general would remain imprisoned, until the West Russian War came. Ever since the end of the war on the Eastern Front, Finland had been protected from the chaos in Russia by the Wehrmacht, but once the West Russian Revolutionary Front stormed the A-A line, Finland was in danger. Now, they could not simply trust the Reich to protect the frontier. To solve this problem, the Finns would gather the Volunteer Anti-Communist Guard, a force composed of Russians in their territories and led by none other than Kirpichnikov himself. The promise made by Finland, which kept a tight leash on the Guard, was that should they drive the Reds out of Arkhangelsk, they could have the land to settle and be independent.\n\nNow, Kirpichnikov rules the small warlord state centered in Onega, and must stand up against the power that is the WRRF. The Finnish still maintain some control over it, but should Kirpichnikov's Guard liberate Arkhangelsk from the hold of the Communists, the Russians of Karelia might finally be free once again."
