 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_RURIK_II_DESC:0 "Major General Nikolay Ivanovich Krylov was once an officer of the Red Army, serving as Chief of Staff for the 62nd Army in battles like Sevastopol and Voroshilovgrad. But as the Great Patriotic War became nothing but great defeats for the Soviets, Krylov was wounded both inside and out, and the stress of constant retreats led to a nervous breakdown. However, the 62nd was unaffected by his affliction, since it had already disintegrated. He and his small band of officers without an army joined the eastward wave of refugees pouring over the Urals, eventually finding his superiors in the Central Siberian Republic. Sent by the Republic to deal with the Anarchist insurgency of the Siberian Black Army, Krylov suffered a humiliating defeat and later faced betrayal by one of his trusted subordinates, General Andreev in Krasnoyarsk, and was forced to retreat his forces in Kemerovo. There, he fell deeper into his stupor, drinking or smoking whatever he could get his hands on to dull his pain and guilt.\n\nBut one day, it suddenly changed. After an evening locked naked in his room with nothing but a carton of cigarettes, three bottles of vodka, and a book on Orthodox mysticism, he walked out proclaiming that he had been ordered to reunite Russia. By whom? He declines to say. His officer comrades were worried for his mental state, a fear exacerbated when Krylov crowned himself as Rurik II, Emperor and Autocrat of all the Rus'. However, their concerns were drowned out by a wave of support from soldiers and mercenaries, drawn by promises of conquest and glory.\n\nRurik preaches an eclectic mix of Russian traditionalism and Soviet militarism. He claims to be the heir to the Tsarist tradition, yet despises the Romanovs; he talks about the virtue of Vladimir the Great, but is atheist and dismisses priests as "charlatans and wizards". His motley ideology is represented by his supporters, a mix of reactionaries, Soviet veterans, and soldiers of fortune. Some in his officer corps suspect that the whole "Rurik" act is simply a charade to rally the peasants' support; if it is, he is doing an exceptionally good job at staying in character."
