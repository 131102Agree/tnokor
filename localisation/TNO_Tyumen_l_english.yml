 ### Leader Bios ###
 POLITICS_LAZAR_KAGANOVICH_DESC:0 "Many thought that, when Bukharin's Soviet Union collapsed, it would be almost impossible for one of his arch enemies to gain so much power as to become one of the most powerful leaders in Russia. However, Lazar Moiseyevich Kaganovich would prove them wrong. An ardent supporter of Joseph Stalin, he opposed Bukharin's policies and was sent to West Siberia, in what would normally be an irrelevant position. When he found himself far from the frontlines of the war, though, he would accumulate power, enough to form one of the largest nations in Russia before the West Russian War.\n\nWith the loyalty of Field Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky and Lieutenant-General Dmitry Karbyshev, as well as the support of the 3rd and 10th Armies, Lazar Kaganovich would declare the formation of the Western Siberian People's Republic, which would stretch from the Urals to the city of Omsk. Unfortunately for him, the Republic was not meant to last long. A combination of the intense Luftwaffe bombings and his two former allies distancing themselves from him would eventually lead to its collapse. In the place of the short-lived nation born from the ashes of the USSR, Rokossovsky's army would gather in the west, and Karbyshev's Black League would gather in the east, and Kaganovich had no choice but to retreat to the city of Tyumen and exercise his control over the remnants of Western Siberia.\n\nNow, Kaganovich has to lead a rump state, a relic of the times of Russia in the Interbellum, through these turbulent times. He may be surrounded by enemies from both within and without his fiefdom, but his revolutionary will remains unbreakable. A hardline Old Bolshevik, Kaganovich will not stray from any means to eliminate the enemies of the state and embody the all-embracing proletarian state as the Great Teacher Lenin and his greatest disciple, Comrade Stalin, envisioned it since the glorious days of the Red October."
