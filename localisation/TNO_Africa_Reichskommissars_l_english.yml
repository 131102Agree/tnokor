### Leader Descs ###
 POLITICS_SIEGFRIED_MULLER_DESC:0 "Reichskommissar Siegfried Müller is one of the Reich's most beloved media darlings: bold, charming and magnetic. The charismatic leader of Reichskommissariat Zentralafrika and the richest of the Reich's three African governors. A distinguished veteran of Poland, France, and Russia,  Müller leads Zentralafrika to operate as the only colony that consistently turns over a profit for Germany, rather than committing near-treasons such as skimming profits or ripping off the Reich on a regular basis. His approach to the governance of Zentralafrika is charitably described as "Laissez-faire", and uncharitably described as "Almost total non-involvement": content to let foreign business concerns ravage the Kongo for all it's worth, while Zentralafrika's coffers grow fat with profits from the tolls from shipping. Meanwhile Müller's German men fritter away their tours of duty drinking themselves stupid, hunting anything that moves, humping anything that wears a skirt and gambling away their pay cheques. That is when they are not whoring themselves out as mercenaries to the other Reichskommissarats and anyone-foreign or German it does not matter-willing to pay for cheap muscle.\n\nMüller's great passion is hunting, regularly taking long trips into the darkest bush to hunt all manner of great African game, and if he should stumble across ANC partisans; then it becomes an opportunity to hunt the most dangerous game of all...\n\nMan."
 POLITICS_HANS_HUTTIG_DESC:0 "In all of the Reich, few names embody tenebrosity as stirrlingly as Reichskommissar Hans Huttig. Once the overseeing commandant of brutal extermination camps during the war, Huttig has devoted himself to ruthlessly fulfilling the National Socialist tradition over Ostafrika. Within labyrinthic camps of African slaves, and burgeoning swaths of revolting tribes he is seen a pernicious enigma of Nazi horror and a mathematician of ruination. For Huttig himself, he prefers to see himself as the only German in Africa who sees the truth: Africa is a continent with an heart of utter darkness; and a fist of damascus steel must crush her subhuman evil.\n\nHuttig's sworn loyalty to the Reich, domestic brutality, and organizational competence has been proved time after time again. From ensuring an effective, pure government, employing only Germans and refusing to use African SS divisions, to the constant drill and battling of his elite garrison, bolstered by the former Anglo population of Rhodesia, Huttig's rigid and militaristic society is more akin to a massive concentration camp than a colonial authority. Yet as his fellow governors leave their dominions to decadence and decay, they are seen as stars for their facsimiles of prosperity and undeserved wealth.\n\nIn return, Huttig harbours nothing but contempt for his peers, solely communicating with Reich and planning for the inevitable conflicts within the south and the east himself.  He has no disputes with the title affixed to him by foreign intelligence - the only Nazi in Africa. To him, Africa needs no one else."
 POLITICS_EMIL_MAURICE_DESC:0 "On one particular morning, a crowd of protestors surrounded the offices of Reichskommissar Emil Maurice, demanding basic welfare and at least some respect for human rights. In most other Reichskommissariats, these protests would be answered by a volley of open fire, and then a swift cleanup and denial of any activity against the State whatsoever. But when Maurice woke up and heard the rhythmic shouts of dissent, his only action was a meek request for the curtains to be closed. The fulminations soon dispersed after the building lay completely still.\n\nOnce the chauffeur and a personal favorite of Adolf Hitler, the inescapable, crippling apathy in Maurice seems to have begun to manifest after leaving the Reich in the fifties to oversee Madagascar, an appointment by the Führer  amid accusations of clear non-Aryan elements in his racial heritage from the SS. Given the choice between execution or exile, he choose the later. Since his arrival in Toamasina, Maurice has shown little, if any, care for the internal affairs of the colony, forgoing meetings and ignoring the screams of those who would have his head all across the island. He has sent pleas to return to the only country he ever loved countless times, all of which have been ignored.\n\nThe outlook has only grown more nihilistic for Maurice as the organized Jewish resistance strengthens and native Malagasy militias establish footholds in the central highlands, all while the militarists continue to estrange themselves with the administration. It is clear to those still loyal that an armed conflict looms near, and yet all he can show is indifference. All he dreams is for exile. He may have helped create this enormous house, but all he desires is to escape it. To be delivered from evil."
 POLITICS_WOLFGANG_SCHENCK_DESC:0 "Once one of the Reich's most decorated fighting aces, Wolfgang Schenck's administration over Südwestafrika is wrought by the air. He is renowned in the fatherland for flying hundreds of combat missions and in the Luftwaffe he is distinguished for expertise in the development of bombers. Domestically, however, he presides over the poorest Reichskommissariat in Africa, lacking an industrial base and relying on imports and gas fees for its runways. The burgeoning air force of the nation is his sole focus, as evident to anyone who ever looked over the Angolan horizon. His planes rule the sub-saharan skies.\n\nOver the years, Schenck has ensured that Südwestafrika is the air hub of German Africa. In other internal matters, he is known for his leniency and the close camaraderie he shares with fellow Reichskommissar Siegfried Müller, who he often attends Safaris with in his personal helicopters or joining in the hunt. Perhaps it is the refuge of the tropospheric clouds, away from affairs pertaining to natives or the SS, that attracts him to the skies. It is where solace lies."
