 #LEADER DESCRIPTIONS
 POLITICS_GRANTLEY_ADAMS_DESC:0 "Grantley Herbert Adams started off as a trade unionist and socialist protester, but times have changed for this Barbadian. Seeing the United States occupy his home island enraged him to no end, but him and his Federal Labour Party have been forced into the effective position of what is known as the 'United States favorite party'. Many see him as someone who has lost his roots and has become the typical power hungry president sucking up to the United States. In reality, he has seen the failures of those before him and is afraid to make any moves in his position to avoid another collapse. This position of almost complete neutrality has worked so far to keep the federation alive, but for how long?"
