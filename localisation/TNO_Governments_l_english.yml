communist_subtype_desc:0 "권위적 사회주의는 중앙집권적인 일당제 국가가 국가를 진정한 공산주의로 이끄는 길이라고 주장하는 사람들을 다룹니다. 가장 흔한 부류는 러시아 혁명의 지도자인 블라디미르 레닌을 따라 만들어진 마르크스-레닌주의입니다. 레닌과 볼셰비키는 1918년 러시아 공화국을 전복하고 소비에트 연방을 선포한 최초의 성공적인 사회주의 혁명을 이끌었습니다. 그의 사상에서 마르크스가 예견한 혁명이 없는 이유를 계급 의식의 결여에서 찾는데, 이것은 혁명을 주도하고 프롤레타리아를 계몽할 전위당에 의해 해결될 것입니다. 일단 혁명이 성공하면 모든 정치 권력과 경제 수단은 \"프롤레타리아 독재"\에 집중될 수 있었고, 이 권력은 산업적인 공산주의 낙원이 달성되면 결국 사라질 것입니다. \n\n초기의 성공에도 불구하고, 소비에트 연방은 국경을 넘어 그들의 이념을 거의 확장시킬 수 없었습니다. 소련이 현대화와 산업화의 약속을 이행하지 못한 것은 물론, 나치에 침략에 의한 국가의 완전한 붕괴를 일부에서는 사회주의의 실패라고 지적하는 반면, 강경한 마르크스-레닌주의자들은 소련의 실책을 국가의 충분한 집산적인 관리가 부족한 점에서 찾았습니다. 1940년대 이후, 마르크스-레닌주의는 지하 운동, 보통 나치 또는 일본 점령하의 국가의 저항세력에서만 상당한 지지를 얻었고, 심지어 몇몇은 파시즘에 대항하여 사회주의를 행할 수 있기를 바라면서 미국의 자금지원을 받기도 했습니다. 하지만 사회주의자들이 즐겨 말하듯이, \"자본가들은 우리가 그들의 목을 맬 밧줄도 우리에게 팔 것입니다.\""
socialist_subtype_desc:0 "자유지상적 사회주의란 마르크스로부터 내려오는 이념적 혈통을 주장하지만 프롤레타리아 해방을 위해서는 무력 혁명의 필요성을 믿는 사람들의 사상을 말합니다. 그러나, 이 부류의 사회주의는 강력한 국가의 권력을 경멸하고 불신하는데 생산수단에 대한 국가의 집산적인 통제는 마르크스주의와 연립할 수 없으며 공산주의의 최종 목표와 근본적으로 양립할 수 없다고 보며, 대신 분권형 권력체계, 지역주의, 직접민주주의를 강조하는 경향이 강합니다. 자유지상적 사회주의자들은 또한 아나키즘, 생디칼리슴, 지방분권주의, 반권위적인 좌파 운동과 중복되는 경향이 있으며, 정부 권력의 분권을 요구하는 것은 노동조합, 노동 위원회, 그리고 다른 지방 노동자 단체의 선호 이념으로 자리하고 있습니다. \n\n자유지상적 사회주의는 19세기 후반과 20세기 초에 잠깐 동안 번성했지만, 장기적인 힘을 확보하지는 못했습니다. 파리의 거리, 멕시코의 언덕, 바르셀로나의 골목에 이르기까지, 이 이념은 피비린내 나는 전쟁 이후 태어났고, 그 불길은 뜨겁지만 짧게 타올랐습니다. 여러 번, 그들은 전복을 꾀하는 국가들에 의해 짓밟히거나, 이념적 경쟁자들과의 자기 파괴적인 반목 속에 갇혀있었습니다. 성공한 반란은 있었지만, 이는 나라를 독재국가로 변화시킬 더 권위적인 지도자들의 앞을 닦아주는 것 뿐이었습니다. 그리고 파시즘의 도래와 함께, 서구에 대한 사회주의자들의 희망은 영원히 무너지는 것 같았습니다. 하지만 사회주의자들에겐 패배는 필연적인 것이 잠시 지연된 것 뿐입니다..."
social_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Social Democracy is an umbrella term covering leftist movements that still wish to operate within a mostly capitalist framework. Proponents of Social Democracy still believe in markets, the ability of an individual to run a business and manage others as employees, and in the freedom to earn and spend money, while also advocating for vast social programs like welfare, free and public healthcare, shelter for the homeless, and good minimum wages among many others.\n\nWhile decidedly on the left end of the political spectrum, followers of Social Democracy and those of other leftist ideologies like Communism and traditional Socialism generally dislike each other, and they rarely intermingle or work together. Social Democrats do not advocate for the revolution and radical rebuilding of the system that their further-left counterparts do, and are more accepting of various other democratic ideologies."
social_liberal_subtype_desc:0 "Liberal democracy can trace its roots back to the philosophies of John Locke. Locke first and foremost believed that all people on the planet are entitled to natural rights, consisting of life, liberty, and property. He also believed that citizens create a social contract with the nation they live in, defining the state as something that exists solely to protect its citizenry, and must use its powers to do so. Therefore, a nation can only rule from the consent of the governed and must use their position to protect and advance the rights of the people.\n\nLiberalism sprouts from the idea that social progress and equality can be brought upon not by violence and revolution, but instead through the creation of laws and policies. These liberals believe in the democratic process, and are willing to work with political enemies in order to achieve their goals, including universal suffrage, universal education, property rights, and the advancement of marginalized populations. Alongside this, they strongly support capitalism and free trade while also believing that governmental oversight is necessary for a healthy economy and safe populace.\n\nDue to the rise of fascism and other right-wing extremist ideologies, many free nations have drifted towards liberalism, and many people see it as the most sane way to counteract such a dramatic shift in the world."

social_conservative_subtype_desc:0 "Conservative Democracy, known more commonly as Conservatism, is the wing within democratic nations that tends to rely more on tried-and-true ideas, traditional values, and varying degrees of nationalism. Conservatives are generally more opposed to change in both culture and law, and for those changes they do approve of they tend to advocate for more gradual implementation.\n\nHowever, proponents of this ideology differ from more radical traditionalists in that they still believe fervently in some form of democratic process, and believe that the people will choose the path towards traditionalism in elections rather than it being needed to be forced on them by an oppressive regime. Conservatives like these will usually concede defeat if they are defeated by a vote and are more willing to work with other parties and ideologies."
authoritarian_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Authoritarian Democracy refers less to a specific ideology and more to a situation where a democratic system exists, but there is a strong central authority that consistently has the power to overrule it as they please. It may be freshly born, like a slowly liberalizing autocracy where the ruler is reluctant to fully cede power to the masses just yet, or it may be the last stage of a democracy's life, like a president consolidating influence at the expense of other branches of the government. It can be tumultuous, such as in the wake of a military coup, or fairly stable, in the case of long-running semi-absolute monarchies.\n\nThe defining feature of an authoritarian democracy is always a strongman leader, be it a president, general, or monarch. They ostensibly rule by the people's will and for the people's sake, but they are often entrenched well enough in their positions (or have the backing of the military) where the people could never hope to dislodge them peacefully. This regime also lends itself to kleptocracies and corruption, where the leader enriches themselves, their family, and close friends with the nation's coffers."
despotism_subtype_desc:0 "Despotism is a wide-reaching term that encompasses governmental systems where power is concentrated on a single individual or group of individuals. These people run the nation according to their own will, and almost always make heavy use of the military and the police to keep their citizens from revolting. Despotist governments very rarely tolerate other ideologies and when they do they have systems in place to prevent those groups from ever gaining power. Opposition forces are treated as enemies of the state and heavily repressed, and if elections are ever held they are either completely rigged lies or for positions with no power.\n\nDespotist governments also usually wish to establish control or dominance over other nations, and maintain extensive militaries to use in conquest and to protect the regime. While Despotists can use nationalism as a reason for their authority, they are not as nationalistic as Fascists and National Socialists and nationalism is usually more of an excuse than any real part of the agenda."
fascism_subtype_desc:0 "Of the ideologies that emerged in the tumult following the First World War, the one that proved to have the greatest success in achieving and maintaining power in Europe was the ideology known as fascism. Borne out of the beliefs of disillusioned communists and authoritarian nationalists, fascism is often characterized as being \"third positionist\" due to its ideological inspiration from both the radical left and right. Although traces of Marxist doctrine can still be found buried in its worldview - it embraces a producer-parasite dialectic, but between nations instead of economic classes - its virulent nationalism puts it at odds with the internationalist mindset of socialism, and it inevitably led to violent conflict within Germany, Spain, and Italy in the interbellum decades. In all cases, the fascist parties eventually won out and forced their socialist rivals underground.\n\nFascism's most defining qualities come from its slavish devotion to the state. The government, often under the control of a single strongman, serves as the final arbitrator and authority in the land. Religious institutions, trade unions, private businesses, and the like are permitted to exist in some limited form, though their subservience to the state's authority is made clear. The government also upholds a national mythos, spinning tales of a noble people with past glories that were unfairly stripped from them, and demands that the populace find strength in unity and reclaim what was lost. They sneer at liberal nations for decadent complacency and socialist nations for succumbing to degeneracy - yet paradoxically view those outsiders as a looming threat who are posed to destroy everything they hold dear."
burgundian_system_subtype_desc:0 "When Germany's luck began running out after the Second World War, the most fanatical members of the Nazi Party - chief among them Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler - sought to reconcile their beliefs in the superiority of national socialism with the increasingly bleak reality unfolding before them. They eventually arrived at the conclusion that the Nazi Party had lost sight of itself and had collapsed into decadence, and that only they were fit to preserve the ideology as truly intended. They increasingly isolated themselves from the Third Reich's political structures, secretively building their own systems in parallel. When Himmler was made head of the SS-Ordenstaat Burgundy, he began implementing his vision unimpeded.\n\nMuch like how many of Nazism's goals revolve around Hitler's increasingly erratic statements, the tenets of the Burgundian System are equally ill-defined: the only way one could begin to define it is to analyze Himmler's increasingly inscrutable actions and cryptic beliefs, which very few outside of the system are able to do. What is clear is that his regime implements Nazi policies in the extreme: the Party is exalted above all other aspects of society, draconian racial supremacy laws are harshly enforced, and Nazi thought is deliberately incorporated into every aspect of waking life. It also impresses a spartan and military-esque lifestyle upon the entire population, in hopes of removing all potential sources of decadence or complacency."
national_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "National Socialism, the iron fist clutching the heart of Europe for nearly thirty years, refers to the various styles of fascism which incorporate fervent racism, extreme militarism, and a  totalitarian, one-party state where individuals subordinated for the common good. It is distinct from other forms of fascism in it's core tenets of brutally enforced racial hierarchy and aggressive, genocidal expansionism as "living space" for its nation's peoples.\n\nIn the German sense, Nazism holds several key tenants close to it's black heart- anti-Semitism ingrained in every political action; A deep disdain for traditional liberal democracies, the parliamentary system and capitalism; and finally it's strong hatred for Communism. While most National Socialist nations are either with or direct collaborators with the German Reich, the term is now often used to describe a variety of fascist movements around the world which echo Nazism's foundations, each with their own unique attributes, such as radical Japanese imperialism."
ultranational_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "Ultranationalism is a vicious blend of rabid militarism and fervent devotion to the nation above all else. Ultranationalists are keen to purge their nations of perceived foreign influence of any sort. Thus they favour autarky, stratification and a strong military involvement in everyday affairs to insure that the country is kept independent and \"safe from outside corruption\". The idea of a glorious state is the key to all things for the ultranationalist, and they will call upon images from the past to stir up and inspire in combination with a paranoid and savage hatred of the other and the outsider. Racism and other forms of discrimination are weaved into all parts of life, to further raise up and separate the ideal countryman from those that do not fit in. In order to make truth of their promises of the \"great nation\", ultranationalism presents the military as the ultimate tool for prosperity and greatness. Service to the state in this manner is therefore mandatory for most and deeply glorified as a part of the nation's triumph over the rest of the world. Ultranationalism has often manifested as part of a desire for revenge against foreign enemies and uses this desire to drive the nation forward. While some differences are known to exist between each ultranationalist movement, they never differ in their mad desperation to see eternal glory rain down upon their lands."
