 ###LEADER DESCRIPTIONS###
 POLITICS_SULTAN_IBRAHIM_DESC:0 "The Sultans have been a part of Malayan culture for a very, very long time. Their traditional role as cultural icons, ceremonial figureheads and focal points in Malay identity placated a population that never grew entirely comfortable with the British colonial yoke. Their roles as collaborators continued even when the British crests were torn from the buildings and replaced with the Rising Sun. Sultan Ibrahim is the latest in this line of collaborators, a ceremonial sultan whose presence in government affairs theoretically lends credence to the actions of the Syonan City government and unites the peoples under its rule. This is the way Malaya has always worked. \n\nBut a New Malaya is rising under the aging Sultan's nose, and he cannot stop it. For Japanese boots and corporate brutality have alienated his people from him, and racial divides stretching all the way to brilliant, broken Syonan-To itself have fractured his country. Resistance grows to his nominal rule from every corner. Some say the National Congress, the only jurisdictive entity under his sole control, is simmering with revolt. And in the hills of Perak and Johore the spectre of Revolution looms, and the ghost of Chin Peng haunts the Sultan's dreams. The Sultan himself is powerless, and behind the ceremonies his own relatives in the Sultanates rap their fingers in anticipation.\n\nFor the Sultan himself is dying, and few will mourn his loss. In his wake, Syonan, Malaya and the Japanese will find a world stripped of illusions. Perhaps the greatest gift he can offer them, therefore, is the future he will provide in his wake. Malaya waits, and beyond it, the Tiger holding its leash."
