 POLITICS_BOSE_DESC:0 "Subhas Chandra Bose, the President and Netaji of the Republic of India, has seen much in his life. Not only has he seen the failure of the Indian National Congress and the growth of the Free Indian Army, but he has lived to see the independence of India, the fall of the British Raj, and the dark chaos of the Second War of Independence.\n\nBose has always fought for freedom, and, despite the silent disappointment of the Japanese, he shall never bend to the rule or demand of any oppressor - not the Japanese, not the Europeans, not the Americans, and not the rotten ship of the INC. However, India cannot stand broken for much longer; with almost 20 years, how long can it be before India is once again in the chaos and terror of war, with brother against brother, in the field of battle? Nobody knows. Not Nehru, not Japan, not America, not even Bose.\n\nHowever, with his former comrades rebelling against him under the matter of change, the nationalists of all corners of Free India tearing at the seams, and the more radical sides of the spectrum beginning to rise up, Bose will have to steer the ship that he has steered for twenty years. Can he do it for twenty more?"
