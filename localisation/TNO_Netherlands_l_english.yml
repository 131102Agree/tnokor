 POLITICS_ARTHUR_SEYSS_INQUART_DESC:0 "Artur Seyss-Inquart is the leader of the nazi occupation of the Netherlands, but a farmer could probably do the same job and maybe even better. \n\nAn Austrian nazi that helped reduce Austria to a mere province of Germany during the Anschluss, he got the job of Reichskommissar because the Nazis believed that the Netherlands wouldn't need a blood-thirsty general or a fanatic politician to run the occcupation government. His friendship with Hitler helped too, of course. \n\nHe has been in the civil administration business his whole life and that's probably the only positive thing he has done for the Netherlands; as the former Dutch territory now has an enviable bureaucratic system that ensures a smooth running of the occupation. \n\nHowever, that's probably the only positive thing Amsterdam can report back to Berlin because Seyss-Inquart's political character couldn't be more dull; when asked about which probable pretender he thinks it's the best for the Reich, he just answers that Hitler is doing a fine job and the next Führer will also do as fine. This neutrality affects his Dutch domain as the various government factions run rampant and attack each other while Seyss-Inquart watches from the distance, believing it's the best system to deal with them. \n\nAs the years has gone by, he has limited himself to sign orders to arrest and execute people while ensuring the NSB doesn't get into positions of power. But it looks like Seyss-Inquart's understanding of the term "position of power" differs from the rest of the world, as most of the low-level bureaucracy is run by members of the Amsterdam Group of the NSB while the higher posts are occupied by Musserites and Volchists, leaving the NSB two steps away from the control of the government."
