 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_PODA_ANNAORAZOV_DESC:0 "Nothing in the past of Poda Annaorazov foreshadowed his magnificent future. A former medical orderly of the Red Army, Annaorazov initially began merely as an insignificant agronomist of the Turkmen SSR during her later days. But as the Communist Turkmenia was destined to fall to the internal dissent, Annaorazov found his place among the ranks of the newly-founded Republican Party of Turkmenistan, eventually rising as its sole leader and the strongman of the whole Turkmenistan, all due to his political wit and extraordinary vision for the future of the country.\n\nA committed anti-Communist, Annaorazov was nevertheless utterly delighted by the Bolshevik efforts to promote a Turkmen nationhood, even if those were driven by their ulterior, imperialist motives, and was never ashamed to take the Soviet lessons to the heart. Although Turkmenistan is a united state, Turkmens are not a united nation, but rather a congestion of different tribes and ethnicities that talk in different languages, that live in different ways of life, the different peoples that have no concept of themselves as a people of the same kinship. The Soviets tried to change it, but failed, but not because of the intention, right in its essence, but because of their own incompetence. Only a strong leader, a man of ambitions greater than himself, consistently resolute in his goals, could accomplish such an incredible feat.\n\nEven in the absence of jailers from Moscow, Turkmenistan stands as a weak and inferior state to its neighbors, and the lack of national consciousness and national unity is what undermines her strength. To survive the challenge of history, Turkmens should become a modern nation and who else, if not the head of the Turkmen, the one rests his power on the most progressive parts of the country, is capable to head their arduous path to greatness?"
