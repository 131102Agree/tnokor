 POLITICS_ALPARSLAN_TURKES_DESC:0 "If anyone embodies the new Turkey, it is Alparslan Türkeş, the Başbuğ. Born as Hüseyin Feyzullah into a Turkish family in Nicosia, he changed his name to Alparslan Türkeş, and emigrated alongside them in the 1930s to a not-so-foreign nation just to the north: the Republic of Turkey. Volunteering to serve in his nation's military in 1938, he quickly became involved with Turkey's fascist groups, many of which were more than willing to serve in their great nation's military. However, Türkeş felt that Turkey had to be made a better nation for the Turks, and that he would be the one to do so.\n\nThe opportunity for Türkeş came in 1942. Frustrated by president İnönü's inaction in the war, he, with other right-wing officers, seized control of the country in a coup. Now, Colonel Türkeş was in power, and prepared to chart a new course for the Turkish state. Joining the Axis forces, Turkish troops fought in the east, occupying the Caucasus. However, as the war ended, Germany took Azerbaijan - not only an oil-rich area, but also populated by Turkic Azerbaijanis - and part of Georgia. With the failure to  obtain Azerbaijan, things began to go downhill for the Başbuğ.\n\nThe effects of Türkeş' insistence on running the economy himself had already started to show, but, with the draining of the Mediterranean, the state of things truly became apparent, as Turkey's economy went into free-fall. In order to hold on to power after the crash, Türkeş had to find ways to boost his popularity. So, he doubled down on the rhetoric of expansionism, nationalism and pan-Turkic unity, with the Italian territories in the south entering his sights. Now, as Turkey's alliance with its fellow Mediterranean powers deteriorates, the time of peace may not last much longer, and the drums of war will once again beat in the Middle East."
