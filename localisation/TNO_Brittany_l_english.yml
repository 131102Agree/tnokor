 POLITICS_OLIER_MORDREL_DESC:0 "To say Brittany's relationship with the Pakt is... complicated, is perhaps one of the greatest understatements one can possibly make about the Reich's little entente. Originally named an autonomous zone of France, Mordrel found himself continuously annoyed by the fact that years on from the war the Bretons were still forced under French yoke.\n\nWhen the Reich forcefully tore what is now Burgundy away from France, Mordrel saw his chance. Proposing that a free Brittany, loyal to the Reich in all ways, would be far more useful to the Reich than the now decrepit French state. Within weeks of the formation of Burgundy, Brittany was declared independent as well in a conference attended by thirty nations. None of which were France.\n\nWhen the Reich tumbled into destitution in the 50s however, Mordrel reluctantly decided to begin importing food from abroad despite the embargo between the United States and Germany. Illegally smuggling in goods to keep Brittany afloat, the Bretons soon realized the value of selling the food to the starving and needy of the Reich. This situation only expanded, for as the Black Market expanded, Germany became more and more powerless to stop it and more and more reliant on its goods.\n\nNow, a decade later, Brittany stands as the staple port for illegal goods crossing into the Reich with Mordrel as its kingpin. While he has never professed any love for the Reich, they have so far kept the black legions of Himmler out of his affairs, and the pipeline of food, media, and much more illicit goods have certainly made Brittany as strong as he had once dreamed, even if the methods were a tad unexpected..."
