 POLITICS_WERNER_BEST_DESC:0 "Werner Best was a staunch German nationalist who bounced between several far-right parties, so it was little surprise that he eagerly joined the Nazi Party in 1930. He became a part of the SS, using his legal and administrative skills to help organize the nascent Gestapo and coordinate the Night of the Long Knives in Munich. After rivals forced him out of his Gestapo position in 1940, he served in the military occupation of France, and was appointed as the Reich's Plenipotentiary to Denmark in 1942. Best found himself in an odd position, as Denmark was still permitted to retain its monarchy, a cabinet and a semi-democratic parliament. Many compromises were struck, and Best even advised against deporting Denmark's Jewish population to the concentration camps for the sake of maintaining stable relations with the Danish government. An attempt at organizing free elections and a series of labor strikes in 1943 led to Best placing the country under German military occupation and dissolving parliament, but the Danish monarchy, cabinet, and much of the bureaucracy was left intact. Best was also oddly ineffective in stopping the majority of the nation's Jews from escaping to Sweden, and rumors of being a Jewish sympathizer have clung to him for decades.\n\nAfter the war, Denmark stayed in its strange limbo. It remained nominally independent, but still under close supervision, and with the threat of a return to German martial law constantly looming. Best still retained his office, and he briefly attempted to implement wide-reaching Germanization programs. The economic collapse of the 1950s caused funding to dry up and the programs were shuttered, but Best still hopes that his dream of turning Denmark into part of a Greater Germanic Reich will one day be reality."
