 ### Leader Bios ###
 POLITICS_ABU_KHAN_DESC:0 "Abu Dusukhambetov's life was filled with toil and hardship. Born in the earliest days of the Soviet Union, his father died when he was a boy, his education was cut short, and he was forced to herd livestock for a collective farm. His ticket out of this harsh provincial existence was the Red Army, where he was able to receive a job, a decent education, and a purpose. He completed officers' training and achieved the rank of Lieutenant, and he became renowned for his almost suicidal bravery on the battlefield. But when the Red Army began to break down after an endless string of defeats, Dusukhambetov deserted and began the long trek home, over mountains and steppes.\n\nWhen he finally arrived back home, months later, he found nothing. His village had been abandoned after continuous raids by brigands, fellow Red Army deserters like himself. With nothing but a battered old Mosin and a woodcutter's axe, he found their camp and killed their leader and his bodyguards. The rest of the bandits decided to fill the new vacancy and proclaimed Dusukhambetov their leader, jokingly calling him "Abu Khan." The nickname stuck, and soon Abu Khan's horseback bandits became a formidable force in the hills and plains of northern Kazakhstan. As his domain grew, he began wearing the title of Khan in earnest, wearing silk robes, holding court, organizing feasts and traditional festivals, and ruling the realm like a medieval despot from his capital of Kokshetau. There are those who call him a lunatic and a barbarian, but Abu Khan does not care. After all, the barbarian lifestyle seems to have worked out rather well for him."
