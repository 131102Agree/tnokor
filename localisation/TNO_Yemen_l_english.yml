 POLITICS_YAHA_DESC:0 "Libya is the fourth shore, the first and greatest of the Italian colonies. Ethiopia is its most populous region, Egypt its breadbasket, and the Gulf Territories the source of its precious oil. The Imamate of Yemen is not much of anything. At a Triumvirate Summit in the late 50s, Mussolini himself committed a rare gaffe, forgetting the name of the current Imam, and quickly switching subjects in his shame. Ahmad Bin Yaha is not a man easily forgotten. He is powerful, but frail. He remains physically imposing even in his old age, but his mind grows ever more feeble thanks to his endless use of morphine. Under the British, Bin Yaha was a dichotomy, swearing loyalty and friendship to the empire even as he worked to undermine it. Under Italy, he is much the same. Were the lands he ruled of greater import, no doubt his underhanded moves would bring the wrath of the Mare Nostrum down upon Yemen, but for now, he rules unchallenged.\n\nBizarrely, for a man who clothes himself in jewels and golden cloth while his people starve, Bin Yaha is beloved by his subjects. Though there are reports of growing subversive movements in the army and civil service, Bin Yaha's face decorates the posters of every street corner, and when he travels, his caravan is mobbed by fervent admirers.\n\nBut he's also growing old. The Imam's visitors kneel before him and kiss his hands, and he pays them all the proper courtesies even if he doesn't remember their names. Though the Italian government is content to ignore Yemen so long as it pays its taxes and tributes, a few are already sounding alarms about how little prepared the nation is for a future without the firm hand of its ruler."
