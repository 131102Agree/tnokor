 #Leader descriptions
 POLITICS_SOTIRIOS_DESC:0 "The most suprising thing about Sotirios Gotzamanis, current Prime Minister of the Greek State, is his continued existence on this Earth. After suffering from a stroke in 1958, the poor Prime Minister never fully recovered - and yet, despite his poor health, he has never been replaced since then. This fact speaks volumes about the current state of the Greek nation - the collaborator government set up by the Axis powers after WWII has so far survived only thanks to the guns of the Regia Marina. However, the internal instability is so severe, with partisan and insurgent groups running wild in the mountains and valleys of Greece and the urban population more and more discontent, that removing the only man who managed to bring a semblance of stability to Greece is surely a recipe for chaos.\n\nFormerly a physician who studied in Italy, Gotzamanis engaged in a successful political career in the collaborationist government, finally ending up as Greece's Prime Minister in the mid 50s, after the nation was devastated by the creation of Atlantropa. Since then, Gotzamanis has pleased his Italian overlords by managing to appease the Greeks enough not to drive them into open revolt, but the collaborator government is still hated by the people, unemployment and economic crisis are still rampant, and partisan warfare has never truly stopped. What's worse, is that the litigious and self-serving collaborator politicians have not yet drawn up a succession plan for Gotzamanis.\n\nEveryone in Greece can see the writing on the wall, and the recent calming down of partisan and insurgent activity is simply the quiet before the storm that will break out once the Grim Reaper settles his score with Gotzamanis."
