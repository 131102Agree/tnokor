 POLITICS_FRANCISCO_FRANCO_DESC:0 "While internationally a divisive figure, it cannot be denied that the Caudillo Francisco Franco clawed his way to his position through merit. With the German victory in WW2, Antonio de Oliveira Salazar of Portugal approached Franco to create a protective union against the Germans. Spain found itself uniting with Portugal in a comprehensive defense-pact-turned-nation.\n\nBut of course, that was the past. In the last decade, Franco has been witness to insurmountable calamities. The disaster of the Atlantropa project destroyed the economy, and Germany going into utter freefall obliterated what little remained. His erstwhile allies in the Triumvirate are each other's throats, ready to drop all pretense of unity over the slightest dispute. The colonization of Algeria in the 1950s, considered a proud accomplishment, has revealed itself as a double-edged sword that has dragged his nation into constant conflict with Italy. Salazar's death and his unfounded notions of a non-existent Law of Succession, that would see Portugal absorbed into Spain under the reinstated monarchy after both Franco and Salazar had died, has raised questions about the future of Iberia under Franco. An attempted coup by disgruntled old shirt Falangists was only just stopped through their removal from power by Franco.\n\nIberia, once proud, has fallen on hard times, and even the Caudillo himself has begun to doubt their ability to stay unified, though he'd never admit this to anybody. He can see the writing on the wall, and deep down he feels that it's only a matter of time before all that he's worked for comes crashing down around him."
