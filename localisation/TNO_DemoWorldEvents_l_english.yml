Despite the Führer's appointment of a legal successor, powerful factions within the Reich have taken up arms against one another with the interest of leading the nation in their vision. The nation is torn with entire garrisons ignoring orders from Germania and flocking to the successor of their choice. Though the gravity of the situation is not yet known, it is estimated that the Reich is either facing or already experiencing total collapse of central authority.\n\nThough not much is known about the fate of the Reich's eastern administrations, the sudden cessation of contact between Germania and her possessions has created speculation on if those regions too will find their fate. What is known for sure, however, is that the collapse of Europe's titan has thrown the continent asunder."

Yet it appears as though not everyone within the Reich is interested in taking part in this destructive war. In light of the collapse of the Emergency Council, Field Marshal Hans Speidel, best known for foiling the attempted SS coup during the West Russian War, today marched into Germania.\n\nOn the steps of the Reichstag, with respected war hero Field Marshal Erwin Rommel beside him, Speidel declared his neutrality in the conflict. The city of Germania will now be garrisoned by the forces of Speidel, Rommel and other Generals loyal to their cause of neutrality, with a stern warning of an unshakable resistance should any side in the civil war attempt to attack the city."

Serving as Commander of the major Reich naval base on Crimea, Dönitz announced via radio that following the disgraceful and illegal seizure of the Reichstag by Hans Speidel, he had no choice but to renounce the authority of Berlin.\n\nShock then erupted across the Reich, and the world, as Dönitz then openly declared for Martin Bormann. Immensely liked by the Kriegsmarine, many Captains have since declared their support for Dönitz's actions and have vowed to join him at Crimea to ensure that the Kriegsmarine remains out of the hands of those who would utterly destroy the Reich."

Even should Speer be able to win over the German people and begin to heal the crippled nation, much of Europe remains consumed by a chaos many view Speer unfit to resolve.

With much of the Heer and the Luftwaffe siding with Göring during the war proving to have been crucial to his success, the new Führer personally thanked the Wehrmacht during a speech at the Volkshalle today.\n\nWith Göring publicly advocating militaristic policies before the war, many now fear how deep the influence of the military may grow, and how long it may be before Germany finds itself in a new war. Yet with the nation in ruins, a collapsed economy and a weary populace however, the true future of the Reich remains uncertain.

Widely disliked by the German populace, it has been the might of the SS which has won Heydrich the day. Speaking before the Volkshalle, the new Führer denounced the decadancy which had corrupted Germany, and vowed to remove all hints of degeneracy from the Reich.\n\nWhilst Heinrich Himmler has offered his warmest congratulations to Heydrich, the international response has been largely muted with deep concern for the future of Germany. With the nation in ruins, a collapsed economy, a weary populace and a Europe still consumed by chaos, many now fear what the rule of the secretive fanatical organization will have in store for the future of the Reich.\n"

Hero of the West Russian War and the man who seized Germania to protect it at the beginning of the war, Speidel refused to accept any of the contenders claims to the Führership and entered the war himself. Now victorious, Speidel bitterly condemned the contenders before the Reichstag for all the death and destruction they had inflicted upon the Reich.\n\nNow taking on the leadership of Germany himself, Speidel has vowed to enact some degree of reform to the Reich. Yet as many hail Speidel as a hero once more for saving the nation from those who tore it apart, so too do many simply denounce him as a vulture pouncing upon the carcass of Germany.\n"

DEMOWORLDEVENT.15.d:0 "From the ashes of a state torn asunder, a victor has emerged in the German Civil War. The bloodiest conflict in European history, the German Civil War saw ideological giants fight, fall, and... rise. When Ulrike Meinhof and her Red Army Faction seized power from Speer's liberals, the chaos and destruction that followed on her conquest of the Reich brought devastation and a taste to the RAF's revolutionary policies for Germany. On the steps of the Reichstag, Meinhof addressed the assembled crowd with a speech decrying Nazism and the wretched institution it sustained. \n\nIt is there that the new chairwoman declared the formation of a united Deutsche Sozialistische Republik, a Marxist utopia aiming to equalize all citizens of the Reich. The future is unknown, but one can expect that the German Revolution will not be a quiet one.\n"

Ferdinand Schörner, principal supporter to Göring's militarists, has led his regiments of conscripted citizens into Germania with the intention of declaring himself Führer-regent for the reformed Reich.\n\nSpeaking to his armies from the steps of the Reichstag, Schörner declared the formal establishment of the Regierung des Nationalen Wiederaufbaus, a state aimed at rebuilding the Reich with Schörner serving as temporary head of state. With the Reich's colonial administrations having severed ties with the central authority in Germania, it is expected that Schörner's first of many "National Reconstruction" conquests will be related to the restoration of that authority.\n"

With recently leaked footage from Germany showing SS convoys moving into Burgundy, a border that has become one of the most militarized on Earth overnight, many observers declared this to be evidence that Heinrich Himmler had withdrawn support of Reinhard Heydrich's claim for the Führership.\n\nYet the true reasoning has now revealed itself. While the international community is still scrambling to make sense of the chaos, Burgundian tanks are now rolling into Paris and the French military, severely weakened by German sanctions, have either been forced into full retreat or had entire divisions destroyed wherever they dare make their stands.\n"

Bennett, of the Republican-Democrats, today won a narrow victory against the National Progressive Party to become President of the United States. Bennett utilized his acceptance speech to call on a bitterly divided America to join together as one nation to face down the struggles of the day.\n\nMild-mannered and averse to political extremes, Bennett believes that a middle ground between both sides of the civil rights debate is possible. He has also promised to expand America's diplomatic and economic outreach with fellow OFN partners and other neutral nations, breaking from the cloak-and-dagger approach of the Nixon Administration.\n"

DEMOWORLDEVENT.19.d:0 "Following a close political race that for the first time saw the incumbent Republican Democrats at great risk of losing the reins of power, the party today breathed a sigh of relief as Republican nominee Lyndon B. Johnson achieved victory in the Presidential election. In his victory speech, Johnson praised the continuing endurance of his party, and vowed to carry on the good work of his predecessors.\n\nBullish but progressively-minded, Johnson shares the conviction of former President Kennedy towards the cause of civil rights. Insider voices claim he has some sort of grand project in the works, aimed at improving numerous areas of American society, but Johnson remains tight-lipped for the time being. Some political rivals have called him a stubborn bully, though many within the Center-NPP have quietly praised some of his electoral platform.\n"

DEMOWORLDEVENT.20.d:0 "For the first time in nearly a century, neither a Democrat nor a Republican will hold the White House. Robert F. Kennedy, from the Center wing of the National Progressive Party, today clinched a narrow victory over the Republican Democrats to become the next President. In his acceptance speech, Kennedy earnesty thanked the American people for putting their trust in him, and promised that he would prove that this trust was well placed.\n\nThe brother of former President John F. Kennedy, Bobby has vowed to honor his brother's legacy by championing the cause of civil rights even further, and to address the issues of poverty and income inequality to create a better and fairer America for everyone. Cynics believe him to be too bold and idealistic to succeed, but millions of Americans earnestly believe him to be the man who can change America.\n"

DEMOWORLDEVENT.21.d:0 "Few expected the result, and even fewer can contain their shock. George Wallace, nominee for the Far-Right faction of the National Progressive Party, has narrowly won the presidency after one of the most contentious and least civil election races in American history. As a triumphant Wallace gave his acceptance speech, he proudly declared that “the American people have called out in one united voice, and they make one simple demand - stop this nonsense at once!”\n\nNobody can fail to interpret the target of these words, as the segregationist candidate has run on a platform of staunch opposition to the previously ascendant civil rights movement. Renewed clashes between segregationists and civil rights activists have broken out across the South, and Martin Luther King and other prominent voices have condemned the sudden reactionary turn of events.\n"

DEMOWORLDEVENT.22.d:0 "In the wake of the bombing of the Triumvirate conference in Malta, it would appear as though whatever chances the fragile alliance had went down in the flames. The incident proving to be the final straw for many, both the Caudillos and the Turkish President have now declared their respective countries' desire to leave the alliance. With two of the alliance's three major powers leaving, it is safe to say that the days of the Triumvirate are over.\n\nAlready Turkey has made fresh calls for its territorial rights and ambitions in the region to be respected, particularly in regard to the Levant, with the Italian military being mobilized in response to Turkish movements in Syria. On their part, the Iberians have expressed little desire to keep up significant relations with their former allies, Iberia instead looking inwards toward its own problems.\n"

Whilst the three German African colonies have previously only enacted cordial yet basic relations with each other, a joint declaration from Siegfried Müller, Wolfgang Schenck and Hans Hüttig has announced the creation of Afrika-Schild.\n\nOfficially an alliance only defensive in purpose in order to ensure stability within the colonies, many international observers have expressed concern about what the alliances true intentions in Africa may be. Whilst the OFN has condemned the 'immoral, colonial alliance', many within the German Sphere have praised Müller in particular for his dedication to protecting German interests and personnel across the continent.\n"

Forces of the newly formed 'Afrika-Schild' have already won several key victories, forcing already stretched thin South African soldiers into retreating south in disarray.\n\nWith the OFN having expressed support for the South African regime for almost a decade, the feeling on the ground was captured by quickly spreading footage of a battle bloody South African soldier, part of a convoy of soldiers retreating to Port Nolloth, who asked the cameras the question that many have been asking:\n\n'Where the fuck are the Yankees?'\n"

Young nationalists and party members march through the streets of Ankara, calling on Türkeş to "Lead Us to Victory". Comparatively, in Italy certain voices in the PNF have shown little to no support for the war, with many questioning what is the point of their spoils if they cannot properly manage them?.\n"

Surely, if the communes are making any kind of stir for the first time in twenty years, it must be in some form important.\n\nReports speak of stirrings from the religious. Those few traders who make their way that far north over the east Siberian trade routes have spoken of entire communes chanting in prayer, of churches being filled to the brim, and of some figure pushing them onward. Nobody knows exactly what has spurred this action, but the people of Siberian keep praying for one man.\n\nThey call him, the Father.\n"

Stahlecker claims that the continued improvement of the economic and industrial sectors, as well as a focus on rebuilding the colony from the Civil War.\n\nObservers have pointed out that the policies of the last regime are the only thing that allowed such violence, and that a strict copying of what was done before will most likely be ineffectual when facing the Herculean task of mending together the colony.
