POLITICS_BENIGNO_AQUINO_JR_DESC:0 "Benigno "Noynoy" Aquino, Jr. lived his childhood admiring the humble news reporter. He listened without fail to broadcasts of reports both historic and forgettable, spoken by voices ranging from rich baritones to deep basses. Theirs is a thankless job enlightening the public with current events, the scion thought, and informing them of what must be done. His pursuits in Ateneo de Manila University all revolved around being a journalist by trade, so he can assume the soothing duties of his faceless idols as well.\n\nThen his father was elected President of the Philippines in 1952. Suddenly, the Second Republic's eyes turned expectantly towards its second President's firstborn son. Journalism became a distant dream not long after, displaced by endless politics and the expectations thrust upon who soon will become President no. 3. That became reality come 1958, and Noynoy found himself at the driver's seat of a country in great turmoil. Yet the sense of public duty his love for journalism had engendered never left him; with that in mind, he thrust himself fervently towards the duties of the Philippines' highest office.\n\n(Few dared to dispute the results. Those who did became frequent hosts to friendly military police, and either changed tune or disappeared. With threats both overt and covert, Japan had made its position clear: their most loyal servants deserve to win.)\n\nIt is now the year 1962, and Aquino Jr. has since spent four years stitching his country into proper shape. Negotiations with rebels, hacienderos, zaibatsu, and many more factions continue apace. Constabularies now enforce Manila's law from Pampanga to Tayabas. Livelihoods return with every new factory and farm built. No doubt future generations will name cities and streets in honor of who they see as a great reformer -- but for the would-be journalist, serving his country and his people is a reward in and of itself."
