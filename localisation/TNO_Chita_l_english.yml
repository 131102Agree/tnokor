 ### Leader Desc ###
 POLITICS_TSAR_MIKHAIL_DESC:0 "Prince Michael Andreevich Romanov was born in exile in Versailles, raised in Scotland, studied in London, and spent the Second World War in Australia serving under the Royal Navy. Although he had slight hopes of returning to a motherland he had never seen with a Nazi victory, they were soon dashed by the creation of Reichskommissariat Moskowien at the war's end. So, Prince Michael settled into a civilian life in Australia, an aeronautical engineer who mostly stayed out of the limelight.\n\nUntil he got the invitation to Harbin.\n\nWhat started out as a dinner party with some White Russian émigrés escalated rapidly from there, and Michael found himself swept up a whirlwind of military escapades, factionalism, backstabbing, and steppe warfare. Next thing he knew, he was being crowned in the Siberian city of Chita by a group of White generals led by Ataman Semyonov (completely ignoring the fact that his parents' marriage was morganatic, rendering his claim to the Russian throne ineligible). The newly-minted Tsar Mikhail II is now stuck between his ally-turned-enemy Konstantin Rodzaevsky's fascist clique to the east, Red Army warlords to the north, Japanese client states to the south, and a post-Soviet dictator to the west. Needless to say, he's had better hands dealt to him in life before. But he's determined to make the best of a sticky situation - assuming the generals ever let him determine anything, that is."
