 POLITICS_FAROUK_I_DESC:0 "King Farouk of Egypt is a man of many, many tastes. To frame him in a positive light, Farouk is determined to make life a party, that every moment should be one of fun and excitement in an effort to never to grow old or dull. To frame him negatively, he is a sinkhole for the Egyptian economy, totally removed from his political responsibilities and an embarrassment for Egypt. The King might have once been a young man, keen and enthusiastic about reforming and modernizing his country. Those days have passed however, and now Farouk wishes only to entertain himself in any way that he can. \n\nFarouk spends his days eating, drinking, and smoking during his quiet moments. In his unfortunately frequent wild moments he spends his time driving through the streets of Cairo at full speed in his red sports car or perhaps engaging in some charity by firing a shower of gold coins into a crowd. If the King finds himself in a particularly active mood, he may get in his jet and fly to whatever destination he desires. His absence in Egypt is joyfully felt, as it usually leaves someone more competent in charge for a week or two. \n\nOn his tours of the world, Farouk puts the Egyptian treasury to ”great” use, spending it lavishly to obtain all the objects of his desires, whether that be a diamond necklace for his latest mistress, a set of coins for his ever-expanding collection, or perhaps a shot at immortality. Regardless of what he purchases, it is certainly never of any use to the people of Egypt. Farouk is not malicious or evil, but he is a man that cares little for the world outside of his immediate vicinity. Politics is a serious, drawn out, and often boring matter for the King, and as such he ignores it. He would rather be happy himself than stress about what the world wishes for him to do."
