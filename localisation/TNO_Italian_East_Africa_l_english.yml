 #Leader descriptions
 POLITICS_VICEROY_AMEDEO_DESC:0 "Amedeo di Savoia-Aosta is a man who can be loved or hated, but not ignored. Nicknamed the Iron Duke and the Hero of Amba Alagi, Amedeo was born into a branch of the Italian royal house, eventually becoming a general of the Regia Aeronautica. In 1937 Amedeo, thanks to his noble blood, was named Viceroy of Italian East Africa, but unlike his more unfortunate brother Aimone, Amedeo immediately took active part in the government of IEA; in WWII, he personally led Italian troops in battle against the British, halting their advance into East Africa with a stunning victory at Amba Alagi.\n\nAs the war ended, Amedeo again dedicated himself to ruling the colony. An efficient governor critical of the fascist system (which gained him the sympathy of the new Duce, Galeazzo Ciano), Amedeo did everything in his power to protect the natives of IEA against the encroaching influence of fascist authorities and Italian companies who sought to exploit the labor of the Ethiopians, Eritreans and Somalis. It was largely thanks to Amedeo's restless work that East African natives tend to enjoy a higher standard of living than in the parts of Africa under the German thumb.\n\nHowever, Amedeo's rule is still one borne out of colonialism, which means that many among the natives still detest him and the Italians. The paramilitaries and rebel groups hiding in the mountains and in the countryside are still a serious problem, and even those natives who aren't actively opposed to the Italian rule still suffer from unequal treatment and poverty when compared to the Italian settlers. As Amedeo grows old and a successor hasn't been named yet, sometimes the viceroy can't help but think of home, and wonder if after all, his work may have been all in vain."
