POLITICS_MA_JIYUAN_DESC:0 "Ma Jiyuan was always destined for greatness, and he achieved it. At least, as great as any minor warlord could be. \n\nBorn into the long line of Hui Muslim bureaucrats and warlords, Ma Jiyuan grew up in a pious lifestyle overshadowed by the war, suffering and poverty pervading Qinghai. \n\nPractically a child general, he attended Whampoa and served against the Japanese, Ma never quite ended the fight. As provinces buckled and an unsteady peace took eastern China, Ma, a stalwart defender of the old Kuomintang, smuggled out refugees and former generals, commiting small raids into Tsuji's territory and never giving the Japanese a chance to retaliate. \n\nHowever, time is catching up to Ma, and the problems of the modern world will not stop at the Ma Clique. Ma Jiyuan has been forced to make compromises as challenges to his rule emerge. The great defender of Sun Yat-Sen's vision still shines, but he dims everyday. "
