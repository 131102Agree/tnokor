POLITICS_HAROLD_HOLT_DESC:0 "For Harold Edward Holt, the recent nomination to become the prime minister of the Australian republic has been the last achievement of a long and accomplished career in politics. Born into a land owning family in Sydney, Holt entered politics at a young age as a member of the Young Nationalists, the youth wing of the United Australia Party, and was elected to parliament at the age of 27, making him the youngest MP at the time. Quickly becoming a protégé of Robert Menzies, Holt continued his career during wartime and rose through the ranks of the Liberal Party of Australia, the newly formed successor of the UAP.\n\nThe war proved to be an immense shock for the Australian nation. In what would turn out to be a pointless war ending in a bitter defeat, the country lost a generation of her brave young men, and as the Japanese sun rose over the Pacific, Australia was irredeemably scarred by its burning rays. Amidst cries for change and a deep political crisis, Canberra cut her ties to London just as Nazi troops completed the occupation of England, thus giving birth to the Republic of Australia. The politics of the young republic were dominated by the Labor Party, but soon Holt rose to the forefront of the opposition, eventually becoming the leader of the Liberal Party.\n\nEventually, the Liberal Party gained enough popularity to reach victory in the 1961 elections, with Holt being finally proclaimed prime minister. Promising to reaffirm the country's ties to the OFN, both economically and militarily, and to finally stabilize the country's economy while also ending the White Australia policy once and for all, Holt won over the nation with his reformist platform - however, only time will tell if his vision of a free, prosperous and fair Australia will be destined to become reality."
