 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_MARIAN_SPYCHALSKI_DESC:0 "An architect in his youth, Marian Spychalski dedicated his life to the cause of the liberation of the Polish working people. Being a member of the Polish Communist Party, Spychalski became involved in the leftist Polish underground since the very first days of the Nazi occupation, forming a partisan group called Gwardia Ludowa. Seeking to establish friendly relationships with the Soviet brothers, Spychalski accommodated the Red Army forces when the West Russian War waged on the eastern frontier of the Reich conquests, hoping that Poles and Russians together will liberate Poland and other oppressed nations of Europe from the Fascist yoke.\n\nBut the Front, disadvantaged by its own internal struggles between commanders, could not bring liberation to his people. Along with his comrades, Spychalski found himself at the service of the Polish ASSR in Western Kazakhstan, which became a refuge for both the Soviet Poles who found hostility in the ravaged Russian land and the exiled Poles who were driven out from their homes by the Nazi invaders. Owing to his fame as a partisan leader, Spychalski quickly became one of the most prominent members of the reformed Polish military. On behalf of the Polish generals, who believed the government headed by the Polish Workers' Party was too dogmatic and short-sighted to deal with the pressing issues in the ASSR, Spychalski orchestrated a bloodless coup against the party leadership, emerging as the chairman of the Rada Ocalenia Nowej Polski.\n\nInaugurating as a military dictator in times of crisis, Spychalski avowed to preserve the state of Nowa Polska and protect it from the power-hungry Kazakh warlords that threaten its existence. Although he still sincerely pledges his allegiance to the Socialist cause and Soviet Union, he isn't ashamed to neglect the revolutionary principles in favor of pragmatic decisions and seek inconvenient allies among class enemies - whatever it takes for the new Polish homeland to survive in the unforgiving, war-ridden land of Central Asia."
