 ### Leader Bios ###
 POLITICS_JABA_IOSELIANI_DESC:0 "Under Bukharin's reign, the Komi Autonomous SSR was dotted with the Gulag system's prison camps, where political dissidents, criminals, and the Soviet Union's other "undesirables" were pressed into harsh labor programs for the state's benefit. Even after the Union fell, the West Russian Revolutionary Front continued the practice, sending trainloads of convicts and prisoners of war to the camps and keeping a close eye on them through the Red Navy base in Vorkuta. It was into this system that Jaba Konstantinovich Ioseliani was sent. A Georgian university dropout who found bank robbery to be a far more lucrative career than academia, Ioseliani was arrested for trying to hold up a train that was evacuating the assets of a Moscow bank. A swift military tribunal found him guilty and threw him in the hold of the first ship headed to Vorkuta. He fell in the with Vory v zakone, the "thieves who make the law" that ran many gulags' criminal networks, and settled into a routine of backbreaking labor that would likely last for decades.\n\nBut as luck would have it, the Soviet Union collapsed several weeks later, and Vorkuta lost its lifeline. The prisoners divided into two groups: those who wanted to work with the guards to survive, and those who refused to break the thieves' code and be "suki." After some brief but bloody skirmishes, the collaborators fled into the Urals and Ioseliani helped organize a grand criminal exodus further inland, far away from the restless jailers of Vorkuta, which greatly improved his standing and got him a seat in the circle of Vory leaders representing their camps. As the West Russian Revolutionary front rose and fell far to the west, Ioseliani grew in influence until he was elected chairman of the circle. He also made several rather lucrative agreements with Dragunov and the arms dealers of Zlatoust, serving as a buffer against the remnants of the West Russians in exchange for arms and weapons. But there are those within the prison hierarchy view Ioseliani's agreement as betrayal of the Vory code, and his lack of ambition for conquest has some whispering about complacence and laziness..."
