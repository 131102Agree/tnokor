 ### Leader Bios ###
 POLITICS_VASILY_IVANOV_DESC:0 "Vasily Nikolayevich Ivanov had a humble beginning as a rural shoemaker before being drafted into the Red Army in the 1920s. In the following years, he was able to join the officers' academy and steadily improved his position, holding the rank of Colonel by the time of the German invasion. He and his brigade fought in the ill-fated defense of Moscow, but were able to pull off a relatively orderly retreat when the Mozhaisk line broke and the Wehrmacht poured through. They went in the opposite direction from many of the other veterans and retreated north, falling in with Marshal Voroshilov's forces. Ivanov was promoted to the rank of General in the nascent West Russian Revolutionary Front, and he was one of the commanders who led the charge in the offensive against the Germans.\n\nHowever, the momentum would not last. Betrayal and internal power struggles weakened the Front, and the Germans and their collaborators were soon able to reverse the tide. Having already liberated and occupied his native home of Vologda, Ivanov made the hard decision to abandon his cause, and his army seceded from the Front and declared neutrality. To him, continued involvement with the rapidly-disintegrating Front would have simply brought more bloodshed to a region that had already seen so much.\n\nThis move has won Ivanov the praise of the people of Vologda, who view him as both the liberator of their city from Nazi tyranny and the bulwark who keeps the chaos of the other warlords at bay. His position has also been reluctantly accepted by both the Front and Reichskommissariat Moskowien, who recognize the usefulness of a buffer state existing between them. But while this policy of armed neutrality has been a successful deterrent in recent years, it is only a matter of time before a warlord calls his bluff and puts his army to the test."
