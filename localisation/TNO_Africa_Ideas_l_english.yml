 WEST_AFRICA_idea_terror_bombing_desc:0 "Every several weeks, Luftwaffe planes from the airfields of RK Südwestafrika fly over western Africa, gleefully bombing any civilian targets they find as a demented form of \"pilot training.\" Only a few scattered cities along the coast have sufficient anti-air power to keep the Nazis at bay, and nobody in the region has enough airpower to force the enemy to turn back for good. This leaves the Luftwaffe free to bomb the suburbs and farmlands with impunity, and all the locals can do is hide and pray that this nightmare will soon end."
