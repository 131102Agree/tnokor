 ### Leaders ### 
 POLITICS_JOZEF_TISO_DESC:0 "The entire life of Dr. Jozef Tiso, Cleric, a Roman Catholic priest, and President of the First Slovak Republic, has been an unparalleled success. From early strides in his education to ordainment in the Catholic Church as a priest, and then a successful career as a moderate politician. It seemed that Tiso was a beacon of hope, a decent and good human being. Yet, by the middle of the 1930s, Tiso's views had shifted toward authoritarian and totalitarian ideas, he had become a radical figure in Slovak politics. Then, when the Nazis occupied Czechoslovakia, Dr. Jozef Tiso was appointed President of the First Slovak Republic. Tiso betrayed his own people, buying into the 'Führer-cult'.\n\nAfter the Axis' resounding victory in the Second World War, Europe prospered for a short time, then came the decade of unrest. The Slovak economy, brought down by the German economic crash, had been all but annihilated. Yet, the Slovak government prevailed. In response to increased unrest in the nation, President Tiso introduced further repression against his own people as a mean of silencing all discontent.\n\nBy 1962, President Tiso's health has rapidly declined and shows no sign of improvement. As Tiso's health worsens, many concerned parties within the government have begun to prepare for the incoming event of his passing."
