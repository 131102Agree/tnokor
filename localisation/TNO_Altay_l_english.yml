 POLITICS_IVAN_ZAVOLOKO_DESC:0 "The people of Ivan Nikiforovich Zavoloko have long been derided as provincial rubes obsessed with a long discarded past. Schismatics, was the common insult for members of the old faith. This offended the Old Believers, for after it all they had merely saw fit to continue their forefather's religion without meaning harm to anyone. In Riga, Zavoloko sought to guide his community and continue his own research in the past, as a collector of old Russian antiquities. When the Empire fell, the old faithfuls thought perhaps a new golden age of worship could begin. Instead, the Soviet Union and then Nazi Germany brought oppression and savagery to the Old Believer communities. Following the Nazi invasion, Zavoloko followed many of his kindred on a long exile overland, fleeing the ruins of a destroyed future.\n\nIn Oyrotia, Zavoloko's first meeting with the native people not get off to a good start. The Altaic residents of the area had long disdained outsiders, especially once the rising Burkhanist religion became seen as a threat to the Tsar and then the Soviets. The adherents of this new religion found little pity for the exiles of a very old one. In a land ravaged by war and banditry, sharing limited living space with outsiders was seen by many as a suicidal move.\n\nFrom such an inauspicious beginning, to a leading role as president of this young nation with a dual religious and ethnic heritage, Zavoloko's rise has surprised many warlords in the region. His patient attention to detail, and his great empathy with citizens small and great has made him the one leader both population groups in Oyrotia will follow. However, a single man cannot be the foundation for an entire state. President Zavoloko and his supporters must succeed in tying the fate of both Old Believers and Burkhanists together on a deeper level, lest the young nation's future will die with its future still unrealized."
