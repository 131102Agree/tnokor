 #Leader descriptions
 POLITICS_CLAUDE_AUCHINLECK_DESC:0 "클로드 오친렉, 1884년에 태어난 그의 경력은, 다른 사람들 처럼, in WW1, where his gallantry earned him an interwar posting to India. 2차세계대전이 발발할쯤에 오친렉은 많은 인도군과 함께 그가 빠른 철수를 지휘했던 이라크로 보내져 막대한 양의 돈과 무기들을 회수했다. 재개된 이라크 전선이 배제됬을때, 오칙렉은 중동사령부의 사령관으로 임명받아 가끔 전투에서 승리를 했음에도 불구하고 계속적인 패배를 경험했다. 엘-알라메인에서의 대패와 침입한 추축군으로부터 카이로를 보호하기위한 쟁탈전은 그가 침략으로부터 영국 본토를 지키기위해 소환되어 중단되었다. 여기에서도 마찬가지로, 그는 성공적이지 못했다, 그리고 1945년이 되자 그의 최선의 노력에도 불구하고 그의 조국은 급속히 넘쳐나고있었다. Watching his homeland fall arguably defined Auchinleck's later career, but it did not deter him in his duty to his country, even in its fallen state.\n\nAuchinleck was elected Royal Party MP for Hampshire in 1947, despite his senior role in resisting the German invasion, due to his status as a national icon. Auchinleck's real duties, however, lay outside the Parliament, and in the tangled skein of resistance cells he helped organize. None of this was obvious until the rebelling National Resistance Coalition appointed him commander-in-chief, to lead the free England he had done so much to bring about.\n\nClaude's determination to protect his homeland and liberate it from Nazi rule has propelled his ascension into British national mythos, a modern Wellington. But it is not yet certain if his efforts have won him more than yet another rearguard action, and another looming defeat. And even in the event of his victory there is no guarantee of success; many enemies lurk around his hard-won freedom, and the bitter work of liberation is certain to come back to haunt him. One thing is certain: no matter what Auchinleck thinks, the England he restores will look very, very different from the England he once defended."
