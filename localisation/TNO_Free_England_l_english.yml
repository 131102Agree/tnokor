 POLITICS_CLAUDE_AUCHINLECK_DESC:0 "Claude Auchinleck, born 1884 began his career, like so many others, in WW1, where his gallantry earned him an interwar posting to India. Upon the outbreak of WW2 Auchinleck was sent with much of the Indian Army to Iraq, where he conducted a spirited evacuation of the territory, salvaging huge quantities of money and arms. When a renewed Iraqi campaign was ruled out, Auchinleck was appointed Commander-In-Chief Middle East Command and experienced continual losses despite occasional victories. A rout at El-Alamein and a scramble to defend Cairo from the encroaching Axis were interrupted by a recall to England to defend the home front from invasion. In this, too, he was unsuccessful, and by 1945 his country was being overrun despite his best efforts. Watching his homeland fall arguably defined Auchinleck's later career, but it did not deter him in his duty to his country, even in its fallen state.\n\nAuchinleck was elected Royal Party MP for Hampshire in 1947, despite his senior role in resisting the German invasion, due to his status as a national icon. Auchinleck's real duties, however, lay outside the Parliament, and in the tangled skein of resistance cells he helped organize. None of this was obvious until the rebelling National Resistance Coalition appointed him commander-in-chief, to lead the free England he had done so much to bring about.\n\nClaude's determination to protect his homeland and liberate it from Nazi rule has propelled his ascension into British national mythos, a modern Wellington. But it is not yet certain if his efforts have won him more than yet another rearguard action, and another looming defeat. And even in the event of his victory there is no guarantee of success; many enemies lurk around his hard-won freedom, and the bitter work of liberation is certain to come back to haunt him. One thing is certain: no matter what Auchinleck thinks, the England he restores will look very, very different from the England he once defended."
