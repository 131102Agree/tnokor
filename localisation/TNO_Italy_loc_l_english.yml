 POLITICS_RFK_DESC:0 "Robert Francis Kennedy certainly didn't grow up in an impoverished family. Part of the Kennedy dynasty of businessmen and politicians, his childhood was a not one of hungry stomachs. Growing up in suburban Massachusetts of nine children in a profoundly American family, he was raised in the context of their Irish and Catholic heritage. Living through the Great Depression most of his child, with being born in 1925, he witnessed impoverishment never seen before.\n\nFollowing his child at Catholic schools across New England, Kennedy decided to serve in the navy after the tragic death of his brother Joseph Kennedy in 1943. Serving in the Atlantic and especially the Caribbean, Kennedy became familiar with serving his country. Historians cite his relatively short service in the navy as a massive influence on his life and his decision to enter politics.\n\nFollowing an honorable discharge, RFK entered journalism school, particularly interested in welfare and social programs designed to help the unfortunate. He was at the peace conference between the United States and Japan, and after the war visited Sweden to write about their extensive welfare programs. With his brother John F. Kennedy as the running mate to Richard Nixon, Robert provided significant support, with John beginning to rely on him, saying that "If I need something done and done quick, I go to my brother."\n\nJFK was assassinated soon after. Robert, depressed with his beloved brother's death, was driven further down with the veto of the Civil Rights. RFK, disillusioned with partisan politics, decided to join the National Progressive Party, determined to make America a true land of the free and a land of the American dream for everyone, considered a run for the presidency. In 1964 he sweeped the elections under an ideal of social and economic liberties, but most importantly, an American idealism seen in few others, an idealism in an ideal-less world."
 POLITICS_LYNDON_B_JOHNSON_DESC:0 "In many ways Lyndon Baines Johnson, often referred to by his initials LBJ, is living proof that the American dream still lives. Born in a Texas farmhouse and raised in humble conditions, far from the glitz and glamour that America's elite grew up in, Johnson has not forgotten the lessons of his modest upbringing. Though he spent several years teaching impoverished children in texas he quickly found his calling in politics. With a natural talent for aggressive persuasion and deal making that would soon be widely known in Washington as the "Johnson Treatment" he began first as a congressional aid before quickly ascending to the House of Representatives, then the Senate where he reigned as majority leader of the Republican and then Republican-Democrat party for a decade. Now he has finally climbed as high as any American can, and has been elected the President of the United States. LBJ has promised to heal the wounds that have been festering in America for decades, and is determined to tackle the issues of racial and economic inequality once and for all. Johnson envisions an American society where every man has equal rights and equal opportunity to succeed. However, with Germany descending further into chaos by the day, and Japan fighting to maintain and expand its sphere, Johnson may not be able to focus exclusively  on the home front, as events beyond his control threaten to pull America back onto the global battlefield once more."
 POLITICS_RICHARD_NIXON_DESC:0 "Richard Milhous Nixon is a complicated figure. Originally a representative, and then senator from California, he rapidly rose through the ranks of Congress through skilled political maneuvering. During his time as a senator, Nixon worked closely with Joe McCarthy in carrying out the Grey Scare, and rooting out suspected fascists in government. And while not as in the spotlight as McCarthy was, there is no doubt in anyone's minds that Nixon still holds anti-fascist sentiments.\n\nA lifelong member of the Republican party, Nixon has never been totally comfortable working alongside the Democrats. The broad popularity of the National Progressive Party dictates that they must, however, and the coalition ticket that won him the 1960 election has made his presidency a living hell. John F. Kennedy's position as the Vice President has driven a wedge in the Executive Branch, as his own magnetic charisma and stunning competence have taken away the spotlight from Nixon more than once.\n\nAs much as he wants to focus on foreign policy with an unstable Reich and the Japanese, civil rights have become an issue that can't be ignored. Racial tensions in the country are flaring up, and people demand action. While Nixon has been reluctant to endorse either segregation or integration, staying on the fence is becoming increasingly costly.\n\nOf course, Nixon is doing what he can to keep the NPP down, including some... extralegal means. With challengers coming at him from all sides, including within the White House, Nixon will have a hell of a time trying to keep the ship of state steady."
 POLITICS_GEORGE_WALLACE_DESC:0 "George C. Wallace portrays himself a both an honorable Southern gentleman and a true red-blooded American, being the only one willing to protect his proud country from the Japanazi menace while preserving the rights and liberties his people hold dear. In reality, his is an opportunist par excellence, willing to mold his ideology as he sees fit in order to maximize the possible turnout at the polls. Seeking to court the fine white voters as governor in his native Alabama, this inevitably manifested itself as a staunch segregationist platform, defending it on all fronts form what he claimed were un-American fifth columnists who sought to undermine states' rights. As the Democratic Party imploded in 1948 and the "Solid South's" party loyalty wavered, Wallace eagerly jumped ship to Richard Russell Jr.'s fledgling States' Rights Party, then to the Patriotic Party, then finally to the National Progressive Party.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Wallace successfully moderated his position just enough to win the support of the NPP's Frankensteinian voter base, and eventually the majority of the nation. Now that he finally sits in the White House, his alliance of convenience with many of the NPP's more left-leaning members is rapidly wearing thin-how do you hold together a party bounded only by hatred of the establishment if you are the establishment? But Wallace likely doesn't plan for the alliance to last much longer. Rather, it seems that he is going to use all his time and effort to legally buttress segregation as much as he can. When it is effectively impossible to dislodge, he will return home, where he shall be forever immortalized as the savior of the South."
 POLITICS_FIDEL_CASTRO_DESC:0 "The Americans needed a man in Cuba to stop Germany getting theirs instead. That man, was Fidel Castro. A socialist revolutionary might not seem like the most likely of allies for the United States, but they could not be picky if it did not want a Nazi puppet on their doorstep. Castro is therefore the perfect counter to this problem, as he despises fascism more they do. He is rather a difficult yet brave man, determined to make Cuba into a socialist paradise for the people of the island. He is confident that his country can become a self-sustaining, modern and progressive nation that will shine as a beacon of socialism.\n\nCastro is simultaneously quite loyal to his benefactors, the CIA. This perhaps intensely confusing state of affairs does have some logic behind it on Castro's part. Cooperation has allowed to him to govern Cuba mostly as he pleases without having to concern himself too much with American interests. It was after all with american aid that he overthrew Fulgencio Batista, the previous ruler of the island. This did come at a cost however. US shell companies are allowed to operate in Cuba as per the agreement that put Castro in power. Understandably, this has harmed his relationship with many of his fellow revolutionaries, who view this arrangement with a foreign power as severe betrayal of socialist ideals. Castro is however steadfast in his belief that he is taking the country down the right path and that by keeping the United States close, he is inadvertently keeping them off Cuba's back. He sees the alliance as something necessary, as means to create the classless society he desires for Cuba. Although popular, his chosen methods to achieve communism has left him walking a tightrope between the anti-US socialists and the Americans themselves."

 POLITICS_CIANO_DESC:0 "Gian Galeazzo Ciano, 2nd Count of Cortellazzo and Buccari, son-in-law of Benito Mussolini, and Duce of Italy, began his career as a bomber squadron commander during the invasion of Ethiopia, winning two silver medals of valor and returning home a hero. In Ethiopia, he learned valuable lessons about people and leading, lessons which have given him the ability to bring Italy to greatness. After the war ended, Mussolini chose Ciano to be his foreign minister, preparing him to be his successor by giving him valuable political experience. As foreign minister, Ciano presided over Italian affairs on the world stage, helping her expand during and before the Second World War through both peaceful and violent means. Throughout the entire war, he managed to keep the Germans from dominating over Italy, fighting tooth and nail to keep his country as an equal partner with the Reich. And when the time came for peace, Ciano fought even further for the concessions that Italy required to make an empire that spanned multiple continents. Post-1948, Ciano retained his position as foreign minister and became much closer with his father-in-law. Knowing his time was near, Mussolini taught him everything he knew about leading, and when the Duce passed away, Ciano took up the reins. As the leader of Italy, Ciano has chosen to take a softer approach to ruling, dreaming of liberalizing the fascist state and returning rights to the people while working with his neighbors rather than fighting them. The path before him is treacherous, and only through gile and skill will Ciano manage to keep Italy afloat in this turbulent world."
 POLITICS_GIORGIO_ALMIRANTE_DESC:0 "During the reign of Ciano, the empire was divided into two camps; those who supported the reforms and the uncertainty and hope they represented, and many bureaucrats, politicians and fanatics who opposed them. Everyone had to pick a side: for fascism or against it, for Ciano or against him, for the future or for the past, with no in between. Whenever Ciano spoke in Parliament, Giorgio Almirante clapped with the others, pledging his unwavering support. Whenever Scorza criticized the Duce of fascism, Almirante publicly mused about the need to protect the empire from its leader. In Verona, Almirante's name was in every conspiracy plotting for Ciano's removal - afterwards, he pledged to continue the great work of the last Duce.\n\nNow, with Italy once more thrown into uncertainty, who were the people to turn towards? As they did in the past, they turned towards those who could protect them, promising them bread and peace - they turned to Almirante. Affable, genial, kind-hearted and polite, Almirante presents himself as distantly as possible from the fascist firebrands that filled the ranks of the PNF - promoting unity and order against divisiveness and conflict, soothing the distressed Italian public.\n\nFew could have imagined such a victory for the Blocchi Nazionali, but Almirante showed the people a party that, while respectful of democracy, would still fight fiercely for what it stands for. What that exactly is, was never clear - it's possible Almirante himself doesn't know. Promising to uphold the legacies of both Mussolini and Ciano, there seems to be no way he can do both. With him and his party now at the helm of the nation, everyone in Italy and beyond seems to ponder the same question - will Almirante fulfill the destiny of Italy's new democracy, or kill it in its cradle?"
 POLITICS_PIETRO_NENNI_DESC:0 "The life of Pietro Nenni is one that seems more fit to the protagonist of an adventure novel, rather than to the leader of the new Italian left, and the new prime minister of the Kingdom. Born into a working class family and engaged in left wing politics since a very early age, Nenni closely befriended a young socialist named Benito Mussolini - even sharing a prison cell with him. After volunteering to serve in the Great War, he joined the fascist movement, quickly bailing out as he realized the dark turn it was about to take. His political convictions growing firmer, Nenni finally joined the Italian Socialist Party just one year before the march on Rome.\n\nNenni climbed the ranks of the PSI, but was powerless to oppose the newly instated regime, leaving Italy in 1926. This did little to stop him, and from abroad Nenni played a vital role in keeping the network of Italian dissidents and leftists that were opposed to the regime alive, with the PSI absorbing many other leftist parties over the years. Meanwhile, Nenni fought in Spain on the Republican side, was incarcerated multiple times, lost one of his daughters in the Auschwitz lager, and himself narrowly avoided falling in the hands of the Nazis (likely saved by his old friend Mussolini), before finally returning to Italy to witness the final fall of fascism.\n\nEver indefatigable, Nenni organized the many scattered leftist forces in the country into one more or less cohesive group - the Fronte Democratico, which he later carried to victory in the elections. The many promises he made to the farmers and workers of Italy must one way or another be kept - but only time will tell to what lengths Nenni, the fiery firebrand of Italian socialism, is willing to go in order to finally do justice for the long oppressed Italian people."
 POLITICS_ALDO_MORO_DESC:0 "Aldo Moro's rise to power is, according to many, reflective of Italy's own journey from fascism into democracy. Born in a small town in southern Italy, Moro began to study law in university, where he started to enter Catholic student organizations. Distinguishing himself as a brilliant student, he became the president of the Italian Catholic Federation of University Students, before being called to arms as an infantry officer during the Second World War. When the war ended, Moro moved his first steps in what would become his political career.\n\nMussolini's regime never quite managed to control the Catholic Church, and thus Catholic lobbies and pressure groups were always present during the fascist era. With Ciano's process of democratization, these lobbies and pressure groups became the foundational bedrock of what would become Democrazia Cristiana - and Aldo Moro had a key role in forming this united, Catholic and liberal front, striving to Italy the change she needs. Soft spoken, polite, well mannered, open to dialogue, Moro rapidly became one of the symbols of the rising Italian democracy, with DC electing him as the candidate for the position of Prime Minister in the elections.\n\nWith the victory of DC, Moro and his allies are free to enact their plans for change - without much ado and rhetoric, with moderation, politeness, and openness to compromise, Moro promises economic prosperity, stability, and a strong and fair democracy. While some divisions are already emerging in DC, with the more Catholic wing somewhat at odds with the more liberal one, the DC is united in their resolve to oppose radicalism, both red and black, and finally bring Italy out of the darkness and into the light. In difficult times, faith can be something to hold on to - and perhaps, with a little help from above, Moro's hopes for a free, peaceful and prosperous Italy will be realized."
 POLITICS_CARLO_SCORZA_DESC:0 "Carlo Scorza started his career in the PNF long ago, as he was among Mussolini's followers in the historic March on Rome. In time, after proving his loyalty and political skills, he rose through the ranks of the Party, finally becoming its Secretary in 1943. He hasn't left that position since, and for more than 20 years, he reinforced a sprawling network of political contacts and alliances. When Ciano became the face of fascism in Italy, stealing the limelight, Scorza remained in the darkness, preparing for the day when he could take what he deserved.\nMany people call what happened in Verona a "coup". To Scorza and his men, it is not so. He just fixed a malfunctioning element of the fascist machine: simply, he had to fix the fact that the position of Duce was occupied by a spineless worm named Galeazzo Ciano, who was ready to sell his own country from under his feet in exchange for "democracy"  and US dollars. Italy, a nation forged by the flame of the fascist revolution, simply could not let it stand, and Scorza, by becoming Duce, only did his duty towards his country.\nIt was just the first step: in order to perfect the fascist machine, many things have to be fixed, reworked, and streamlined. Scorza has promised that he will cement the complete dominance of the party over the nation, and of the nation over the Mediterranean: his men rallied around his promises to rekindle the flame of the fascist revolution. The Duce made many promises, but it's hard to say how many of them will be kept. International observers fear the new Duce, lamenting that Italy has abandoned Ciano's promises of freedom: time will tell how much, if at all, Scorza will succeed in breathing new life into the fascist state, and what that will mean for Europe and the world."
